# What has been tried in the S6 reconstruction

The originating construction is due to the programme circulated by **Levent Alpöge and produced with Claude**. Its period data, and their later use in Yang–Mills maps, are credited with exact locators in the [attribution clarification](../ATTRIBUTION.md). The dated archive and its own mathematical qualifications are retained.

This page is a cold-start map for a reader encountering this repository without
any prior context. The underlying source is a proposed construction of a compact complex
threefold whose **underlying smooth manifold is claimed to be the six-sphere
S⁶**, with a torus fibration over ℙ¹ and specially described singular fibres.
The public archive contains the original transcription, the dated audit, the
later calculations, complete TeX sources and exact check records. This page does
not replace those proofs; it records why each route was attempted, what the
calculation actually produced, and where that result stops.

There are two connected but distinct aims:

1. **Reconstruct the specific S⁶ construction.** Derive its maps, attachments,
   fibration and deformations from the stated geometric data, rather than
   treating printed matrices as if their geometric origin were automatic.
2. **Investigate structures suggested by those explicit maps.** In particular,
   test the marked Niemeier–Leech and octonionic/triality constructions and
   their mod-12 arithmetic. This is a search for exact higher-order structure,
   not an assumption that a higher-dimensional analogue must be a complex
   structure or a physical theory.

Here “24-dimensional” refers to the rank of the Niemeier and Leech lattices;
“triality” refers to the three 8-dimensional octonionic summands, and “mod 12”
refers to the quotient obtained by composing the explicitly computed value-group
inclusions. Those terms therefore name concrete source objects and maps, not
unstated background assumptions.

The motivation statements below are retrospective route descriptions, not
quotations from private working records. “Result” means a result recorded in the
frozen source; the documentation pass did not newly reprove these theorems.

## 1. Deriving the finite-fibre attachment maps

**Question.** Can the topology be computed from the maps supplied by the
construction, instead of from matrices whose geometric realization has not been
shown?

**Route and reason.** Keep the original affine generators, ramified base
changes, orientations and translation vectors at the two finite fibres, and
calculate the covers and attachment kernels explicitly.

**Recorded result.** The two central product covers have degrees 9 and 8. The
full central attachment kernel is
\(\langle\widetilde G_j^{m_j}t_{-v_j}\rangle\cong\mathbb Z\), not merely a
single relation known to lie in that kernel. The normal lines have explicit
smooth trivializations while retaining exact holomorphic orders 3 and 4.

**Limit.** These local certificates do not, by themselves, establish the
complete global identification with S⁶.

## 2. Recovering the fibration intrinsically

**Question.** Is the fibration an intrinsic feature of the threefold, so that a
deformation cannot be dismissed as a change of marking?

**Route and reason.** Compute the relative-canonical evaluation divisor and the
invariant Laurent sections on the original fourth-power cover, retaining the
specified projective coordinates.

**Recorded result.** The source obtains
\(\omega_X\simeq\mathcal O_X(-2S_2)\) and the full anticanonical graded ring
\(\mathbb C[U,V]\), with degrees 1 and 2. Its degree-two sections recover the
original map to \(\mathbb P^1\), with the projective-coordinate choice made
explicit.

**Limit.** This analytic certificate is not, on its own, an independent proof
of every global input of the proposed construction.

## 3. Testing deformation and a uniqueness claim

**Question.** Does an actual period parameter change the constructed threefold,
rather than merely changing a coordinate presentation?

**Route and reason.** Retain \(\beta_c=\beta^{\rm part}+c\), the period matrix and
all three critical values. First compute the fibre deformation; then use the
intrinsically recovered fibration and its three fixed critical sections to test
the whole threefold.

**Recorded result.** On the admissible parameter discs specified in the source,
the calculation gives an explicit Beltrami matrix and
\(\mathrm{KS}_{X_{c_*}}(\partial_c)\ne0\). The global step fixes the three
critical values \(0,1,\infty\), so a first-order trivialization would have to
preserve the displayed fibration before the nonzero fibre class is reached.

**Limit.** This result does not assert pairwise nonisomorphism for every pair of
unmarked parameters, nor an exhaustive classification of all deformations.

## 4. Transporting the cubic through Niemeier–Leech neighbours

**Question.** Does the proposed 24-dimensional/triality/mod-12 pattern yield
exact maps and arithmetic, rather than a visual analogy between lattices?

**Route and reason.** Retain the marked Niemeier neighbour construction, the
fixed octonionic frame and the cubic \(F=\tau\circ\mathcal L\), and compute the
maps on the groups generated by its values.

**Recorded result.** The value-group inclusions have matrices
\(\operatorname{diag}(1,4,1)\) and \(\operatorname{diag}(1,1,3)\), with successive
quotients \(\mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z\), \(\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z\), and total quotient
\(\mathbb Z/12\mathbb Z\). The equal-diagonal Albert determinant retains the
exact term \(\lambda^3-\lambda(y,y)+2F(y)\).

**Limit.** These are inclusions of additive groups generated by cubic values,
not an assertion that the original lattices are equal or that a nonlinear image
is its generated group. No global higher-sphere construction or physical model
follows from this calculation alone.

## 5. Comparing the Wilson and retained embeddings literally

**Question.** What exact structure is shared by Wilson’s established Leech
lattice construction and the retained Niemeier/Leech embeddings, when they are
put in the same octonionic coordinates?

**Route and reason.** Compute literal intersections in the original marked
frame, rather than treating different presentations as unrelated.

**Recorded result.** Both intersections are
\[
\Lambda_{\rm cyc}\cap\mathcal L(N)
 =\Lambda_{\rm cyc}\cap\mathcal L(\Lambda_{\rm L})
 =\{\sqrt2(a,a,a):a\in D_4\},
\]
where \(D_4\) consists of integer vectors of even coordinate sum in the first
four original Cayley coordinates. The common lattice has Gram matrix
\(6G_{D_4}\), determinant 5184 and minimum squared norm 12. On it, the cubic
generates \(4\sqrt2\,\mathbb Z\) but does not attain \(12\sqrt2\).

**Limit.** This is a rank-four intersection, not an identification of the
complete rank-24 embeddings or their nonlinear cubic images. Wilson’s
construction is an established input, not a new construction claimed here.

documentation, certify every global step of the S⁶ claim, establish a CDP20
counterexample, or establish a Yang–Mills mass-gap result.
