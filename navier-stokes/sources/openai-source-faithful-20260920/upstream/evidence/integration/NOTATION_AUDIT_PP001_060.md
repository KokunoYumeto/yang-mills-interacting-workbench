# Notation-family fidelity audit: official PDF pages 001--060 (bounded scope)

Audit date: 2026-09-20

## Exact scope

This audit covers official PDF pages **001--012 and 019--060**, and only the corresponding reconstruction fragments:

- `reconstruction/sections/pp001-006.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp007-012.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp019-024.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp025-030.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp031-036.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp037-042.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp043-048.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp049-054.tex`
- `reconstruction/sections/pp055-060.tex`

Pages 013--018 are expressly excluded because they were audited separately. The pass was limited to glyph-family fidelity: `\mathcal`, `\mathscr`, `\mathsf`, `\mathfrak`, `\boldsymbol`, ordinary math italic, and ordinary roman. It did not alter prose, page/formula markers, formula order, equation structure, labels, references, or publication files.

No actionable family mismatch was found in `pp007-012.tex` or `pp019-024.tex`; those two files were not edited.

Every scoped page was traversed in the structured output. Candidate glyphs were classified from their embedded font runs and neighboring runs on the same PDF baseline, not from plain-text extraction. The 180-dpi frozen renders were used to check glyph appearance and mathematical role, with targeted enlarged inspection on pages 6, 19, 25, 27, 34, 36--43, 46--52, 55, 56, and 60. The coordinates below are MuPDF user-space `x,y` baselines from the structured output.

The embedded subsets used in this PDF resolve as follows:

| Embedded font | Family used in the source | Audit rule |
|---|---|---|
| `JYFHIJ+rsfs10` | rsfs script | Encode letter runs as `\mathscr` |
| `WSDGPG+EUFM10` | Euler Fraktur | Encode letter runs as `\mathfrak` |
| `PGQVUE+CMSS10`, `BNEDNK+CMSS8` | Computer Modern sans serif | Encode letter runs as `\mathsf` |
| `CFFJWH+CMSY10` | Computer Modern symbols | An uppercase *letter* run is calligraphic; operators and relation glyphs from this font are not thereby calligraphic variables |
| `UMHUTX+PazoMath-BoldItalic` | bold math italic | Encode the corresponding source vector/Greek run as `\boldsymbol` when present |
| `NSFDSI+URWPalladioL-Ital`, `KADRGS+PazoMath-Italic` | ordinary math italic | Do not add a special alphabet command |
| `MCXIFN+URWPalladioL-Roma`, `SOSTRQ+CMR10` | ordinary roman | Preserve roman text/operator/numeral use |

## Deliberate non-changes and disambiguations

- **Stress notation is role-sensitive.** On p. 19 at `y=611`, both profile glyphs `T_0` (`x=85` and `x=157`) are `CFFJWH+CMSY10`, while the physical stress `T` at `x=97` is ordinary italic `NSFDSI`. The glossary line therefore remains `\mathcal T_0,T=q^{-A-1/2}\mathcal T_0`. The same distinction appears on p. 27 at `y=273`: physical `T` is ordinary italic at `x=129`, while profile `T_0` is `CFFJWH+CMSY10` at `x=193`. Conversely, the named base stress `\mathcal T_{\mathrm{phys}}` on p. 60 is explicitly calligraphic.
- **Interval names are not uniform by spelling alone.** On p. 21 the reserved profile intervals at `y=482` use calligraphic `I` (`CFFJWH+CMSY10`), while `I_m` at `(107,532)` is ordinary italic `NSFDSI`; the existing distinction was retained.
- **Generic and positive-order streamfunctions differ.** The p. 56 generic `S` is ordinary italic, but `S_n` is calligraphic by the distinct embedded font runs listed above. The p. 60 reference at `(330,269)` confirms the calligraphic positive-order family. This resolves a visual ambiguity without relying on extracted text.
- **The fixed normalization is not every letter `C`.** `C_Q,C_N,C_p,C_k,C_\Psi,C_{\mathrm{rep}},C_{N,m},C^k,C_c^\infty` and generic estimate constants remain ordinary italic/roman as printed. For example, p. 43 generic bound constants near `y=203,245,291,316,329,341,359` are ordinary `NSFDSI`, unlike the normalization at `y=611` in `PGQVUE+CMSS10`.
- **Bold vectors remain bold where the source is bold.** The p. 52 coefficient vectors `\boldsymbol\alpha_n,\boldsymbol\beta_n` and bold/roman right-hand-side vectors were already source-faithful. Only the false page-43 bold encodings of ordinary `d,c,p` and Fraktur `m` were removed.
- `CFFJWH+CMSY10` also supplies operators, delimiters, and relations. Only uppercase letter runs whose mathematical role and render identify a named calligraphic variable were changed.

The two existing `\qquad` repairs in `pp025-030.tex` are present in the post-audit file. A whole-scope PCRE2 scan found no raw unescaped `quad` or `qquad`. All nine fragments retain their original page-marker, formula-marker, and line counts; the seven edited fragments retain totals 69, 244, 281, 280, 234, 206, and 288 marked mathematical occurrences respectively. Residual scans found no remaining plain `D_X` in the audited named-operator contexts, no false `\boldsymbol` in `pp043-048.tex`, no plain quadratic-map `Q_\eta` in the repaired lemma/equation contexts, and no plain residual operator `R` in the repaired `\mathscr R` contexts.
