# Static manuscript-to-Lean map

Record: `NS-MANUSCRIPT-LEAN-MAP-20260920-001`  
Audit date: 2026-09-20  
Machine-readable companion: [`MANUSCRIPT_LEAN_MAP.json`](MANUSCRIPT_LEAN_MAP.json)

## Status and scope

This is a **static source concordance**, not a Lean build certificate. No Lean, Lake, or Elan process was started for this audit. In particular, this work did not elaborate or typecheck the source, reproduce `#print axioms`, inspect a compiled artifact, or observe a successful build. The `sorry_count`, `status: proved`, and axiom lists in `formalization.yaml` are repository metadata, not results independently reproduced here.

The concordance covers all 80 numbered theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, definition, and remark environments in the complete reconstruction (`reconstruction/main.tex`, Sections 1-10 and Appendices A-C). Manuscript locators are one-based lines at which environments begin. The sole split-label case is Lemma 5.1: its environment begins at `pp043-048.tex:457`, and `\label{lem:5.1}` is on line 458.

The frozen repository says its scope is “Full formalization of main results” at `formalization.yaml:48` and labels review status “self-assessed” at line 104. Its `alignment` section explicitly pairs manuscript Theorem 1.1 with `NavierStokes.Comparator.navier_stokes_breakdown_R3` at lines 111-112 and Corollary 10.6 with `NavierStokes.Comparator.navier_stokes_breakdown_periodic` at lines 115-116. The remaining correspondences below are conservative static source-reading judgments; none is promoted to an official alignment.

The receipt describes the Lean repository as a “complementary formal main-result authority; not transcription authority.” That limitation governs this map.

## Coverage categories

| Code | Category | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|---:|
| OA | `official_alignment` | `formalization.yaml` explicitly aligns the manuscript statement with the public declaration. Static inspection confirms that the named declaration and adapter chain exist. | 2 |
| SS | `strong_static_correspondence` | A declaration, or a small explicit package, substantially mirrors the manuscript result. This is not an official alignment and is not a build claim. | 38 |
| PS | `partial_static_correspondence` | Exact declarations cover identifiable formulas, clauses, or construction components, but not the whole numbered result as one theorem. | 24 |
| IP | `indirect_pipeline_only` | Relevant modules or downstream packages consume the subject, but no declaration-level match for the complete numbered result was identified. | 14 |
| NI | `not_identified` | No defensible declaration-level or pipeline correspondence was identified in this bounded audit. | 2 |

The IDs in the statement matrix resolve to exact names, source files, one-based declaration-header lines, and dependency roles in the declaration catalog below and in the JSON companion.

## Import and dependency spine

- `NavierStokes.lean` imports `NavierStokes.ComparatorSolution` and `NavierStokes.PaperResults`.
- `NavierStokes/ComparatorSolution.lean` imports the whole-space and periodic comparator adapters.
- `NavierStokes/ComparatorR3Theorem.lean` imports the whole-space theorem/candidate/comparison bridge; `NavierStokes/ComparatorTheorem.lean` imports the periodic candidate and comparator bridge.
- `NavierStokes/PaperResults.lean` imports the periodic theorem, local angular/heat results, and `PaperAdditionalResults`.
- `NavierStokes/PaperAdditionalResults.lean` is a broad import-only aggregator. A module appearing there is **not**, by itself, evidence that any manuscript statement is formalized.

## Explicit gaps and limits

The two numbered manuscript items for which no static correspondence was identified are Definition 3.3 and Remark B.9.

The following 14 items are represented only through a broader dependency pipeline, not by an identified declaration-level match for the complete statement: Lemmas 4.8 and 4.9; Propositions 4.10 and 5.3; Proposition 7.2, Corollary 7.3, Lemma 7.4, Proposition 7.6, and Corollary 7.8; Propositions 8.3 and 8.4 and Lemma 8.8; Proposition 9.1; and Proposition A.4.

The 24 `PS` items have exact component declarations but remain incomplete at the numbered-statement level. They must not be described as full formalizations on the strength of this map. Conversely, a negative finding here means only that this bounded static audit did not identify the declaration; it is not proof that no relevant declaration exists among the 2,659 `.lean` files in the frozen tree.

Every locator below is relative to the frozen repository checkout. The line is the one-based declaration header. “Role” describes how the declaration participates in this concordance; it is not a claim about successful compilation.

## Bottom line

The static source provides an explicit official path for exactly two numbered manuscript results: Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 10.6. It also contains a substantial network of declaration-level counterparts for many intermediate constructions and appendices, but a filename, import, suggestive theorem name, or downstream use is not treated as full coverage. Any stronger claim requires a successful build and, for statement identity beyond the two metadata alignments, a separate semantic proof of equivalence.
