# 1. Original Hamiltonian, physical state, and geometric input

Fix an integer \(L\ge2\). The vertices are
\(\mathsf V_L=\{-L,\ldots,L\}^3\). A physical link
\(e=(n,i)\) is oriented from \(n\) to \(n+\mathbf e_i\) whenever
both endpoints are vertices. Its independent variable is \(U_e\in SU(2)\);
an inverse traversal contributes \(U_e^{-1}\). Every contained elementary
face \(p=(n;i,j)\), \(i<j\), is included, with
\[
W_p=\operatorname{tr}\left[
 U_i(n)U_j(n+\mathbf e_i)U_i(n+\mathbf e_j)^{-1}U_j(n)^{-1}
\right].                                                    \tag{1.1}
\]
Write \(\mathsf E_L,\mathsf P_L\) for these complete sets, and
\[
N=3(2L)(2L+1)^2,\qquad M=3(2L)^2(2L+1).
\]
The Hilbert space is \(\mathcal H_L=L^2(SU(2)^{\mathsf E_L},dU)\),
with product Haar probability measure and inner product conjugate-linear
in its first entry. The differential operators and all physical constants are
\[
T_a=-i\sigma_a/2,\quad
X_{e,a}f=\left.\frac{d}{dt}f(\ldots,e^{tT_a}U_e,\ldots)\right|_{t=0},
\quad E_e=-\sum_{a=1}^3X_{e,a}^2,
\]
\[
H=\kappa\sum_{e\in\mathsf E_L}E_e
       +b\sum_{p\in\mathsf P_L}(2-W_p),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{2g_{\rm YM}^2}{a},\quad
b=\frac{1}{2g_{\rm YM}^2a},\quad
\xi=\frac b\kappa=\frac1{4g_{\rm YM}^4},\quad a,g_{\rm YM}>0.       \tag{1.2}
\]
In the original metric \(c(X,Y)=-\operatorname{tr}(XY)/2\), the
orthonormal frame is \(2T_a\), so \(\Delta_e^c=4\Delta_e^T\).
Thus the electric term in (1.2) also equals
\(-g_{\rm YM}^2\sum_e\Delta_e^c/(2a)\). No coefficient or energy
origin is changed. In particular the scalar \(2bM\) remains in \(H\).

The original geometric condition remains
\[
\operatorname{Im}\tau
\left(\operatorname{Im}\beta-
\frac{6(\operatorname{Im}\mu)^2}{\operatorname{Im}\tau}\right)\ne0.
                                                               \tag{1.3}
\]
The input magnetic patch uses
\(L_T=\operatorname{Im}\tau_T,\ q_T=-\operatorname{Im}\beta_T,
m_T=\operatorname{Im}\mu_T,\ D=L_Tq_T+6m_T^2>0\) and
\(\theta=2\pi a^2/D\). Its exact projected small-angle state, proved
in the parent source, is
\[
\chi_\theta=-\frac23\theta^2 v_{w^{\rm nat}}+O_{H^1}(\theta^4),
\qquad w^{\rm nat}_{(n,1)}=n_2^2,\quad
w^{\rm nat}_{(n,2)}=w^{\rm nat}_{(n,3)}=0.                         \tag{1.4}
\]
The angle remainder in (1.4) is a fixed-regulator input, not a bound
claimed uniform here. The result below concerns its actual electric
state with the exact original weights.
Sections20--21 additionally retain the entire finite-angle product.
Section21 proves its negative-sector weight and vacuum-coefficient
bounds at every positive coupling. Sections22--23 control the full product
norm and energy remainders on the prescribed cusp at fixed
\(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\), with its denominator, spectral comparison and
fixed-coupling energy escape.

The product Laplacian on this compact connected manifold has domain
\(H^2\), form domain \(H^1\), and compact resolvent. Its smooth bounded
potential preserves these domains. A lowest form minimizer can be
chosen nonnegative by the gradient inequality for the modulus, obtained
at its zeros by approximation with \(\sqrt{|f|^2+\epsilon^2}\).
Elliptic regularity and the strong maximum principle make it smooth and
strictly positive. Write it as \(\psi>0\), with
\(\int\psi^2dU=1\), and write its physical energy as \(\mathcal E\).
Integration by parts using \(H\psi=\mathcal E\psi\) gives
\[
\mathfrak q_{H-\mathcal E}[\psi F]
 =\kappa\sum_{e,a}\int\psi^2|X_{e,a}F|^2dU.                    \tag{1.5}
\]
A second ground eigenfunction divided by \(\psi\) would have all
derivatives zero in (1.5), hence be constant. This proves simplicity.
The gauge action \(U_e\mapsto g_{s(e)}U_eg_{t(e)}^{-1}\) preserves
the operator, form, and positive unit vector; consequently \(\psi\)
is gauge invariant. All states below are formed from this same vacuum.

For each link set
\[
r_e=\#\{p:e\in\partial p\},\quad
W_e^{\star}=\sum_{p\ni e}W_p,\quad
t_{ef}=\#\{p:e,f\in\partial p\},\quad
\gamma_e=\langle\psi,E_e\psi\rangle,\quad v_e=(E_e-\gamma_e)\psi.
\]
Here \(2\le r_e\le4\), including boundary links. Define the actual matrices
\[
C_{ef}=\langle v_e,v_f\rangle,\qquad
\mathcal N_{ef}=\langle v_e,(H-\mathcal E)v_f\rangle.             \tag{1.6}
\]
They are real symmetric positive-semidefinite matrices. Smoothness of
\(\psi\) supplies every operator and form domain used in (1.6).

# 2. A local projection and an exact comparison operator

Let \(S\subset\mathsf E_L\) be a nonempty set of links. It need not be
connected. Define
\[
\mathsf J(S)=\{p:\partial p\cap S\ne\varnothing\},\quad
m_S=|\mathsf J(S)|,\quad
W_S=\sum_{p\in\mathsf J(S)}W_p,\quad H_S=\sum_{e\in S}E_e,
\]
\[
H_{\rm ext,S}=\kappa\sum_{e\notin S}E_e
       +b\sum_{p\notin\mathsf J(S)}(2-W_p).                    \tag{2.1}
\]
The last operator acts on the exterior tensor factor only. Its bottom
energy is \(\mathcal E_{\rm ext,S}\); if that factor is empty it is the
zero operator on \(\mathbb C\). The exact decomposition is
\[
H=\kappa H_S+H_{\rm ext,S}+2bm_S-bW_S.                          \tag{2.2}
\]
Every face meeting \(S\), including faces crossing its boundary, is
present in \(W_S\). Every other face is present in \(H_{\rm ext,S}\).
The constant terms total \(2bM\) in both (1.2) and (2.2).

The map
\[
(P_S f)(U_{S^c})=\int f(U_S,U_{S^c})\,dU_S,\qquad Q_S=I-P_S    \tag{2.3}
\]
is understood with its output lifted as a function constant on \(S\).
Fubini proves \(P_S=P_S^*=P_S^2\). Its range is
\(\mathbb C1_S\otimes L^2(SU(2)^{S^c})\), and its kernel consists
of functions of zero conditional Haar integral on \(S\).
It commutes with all link Casimirs and with exterior operators, and
preserves smooth functions and Sobolev domains. Each plaquette in
\(W_S\) contains a link of \(S\) exactly once in the fundamental or
inverse fundamental representation. Integration of that link is zero:
the substitution \(U\mapsto -U\) changes its matrix entries' signs.
Therefore
\[
P_SW_SP_S=0.                                                   \tag{2.4}
\]
This is an operator identity, not a statement that the interacting
vacuum has a Haar marginal. Haar invariance under endpoint left/right
multiplication also proves that \(P_S,Q_S\) intertwine the gauge action.

Take as a trial vector the constant on \(S\) tensored with an exterior
ground vector. Equation (2.4) makes its \(W_S\) expectation zero.
The full variational principle gives
\[
\mathcal E\le\mathcal E_{\rm ext,S}+2bm_S.
\]
Consequently the exterior self-adjoint operator
\[
K_S=H_{\rm ext,S}+2bm_S-\mathcal E\quad\hbox{satisfies }K_S\ge0.
                                                               \tag{2.5}
\]
No gap of \(K_S\) is assumed or needed. Put
\(B_S=\kappa H_S+K_S\). It is a sum of nonnegative operators on
different tensor factors. Their spectral resolutions strongly commute;
the operator domain of their sum is their domain intersection. The
full smooth vacuum belongs to that domain, and its exact equation is
\[
B_S\psi=bW_S\psi.                                             \tag{2.6}
\]
This identity retains the original interaction and exterior vacuum
dependence. It is not a free-vacuum eigen-equation.

The single-link eigenvalues of \(E_e\) are \(j(j+1)\),
\(j=0,\frac12,1,\ldots\), with the constant as its unique zero vector.
Indeed the Pauli matrices give \(-\sum_aT_a^2=3I/4\) on the
fundamental representation, and the spin raising/lowering matrices give
\(j(j+1)\) on each higher representation. Completeness of their
matrix coefficients under product Haar measure gives the joint spectral
decomposition. Thus \(H_S\ge(3/4)Q_S\).
On \(Q_S\mathcal H_L\), \(B_S\ge3\kappa/4\). Define
\[
R_S=Q_S(B_S|_{Q_S\mathcal H_L})^{-1}Q_S.
\]
Joint spectral calculus gives, without a Neumann expansion,
\[
\|R_S\|\le\frac4{3\kappa},\qquad
\|E_eR_S\|\le\frac1\kappa\quad(e\in S).                      \tag{2.7}
\]
For the latter assertion the multiplier is
\(\lambda_e/(\kappa\sum_{f\in S}\lambda_f+k)\le1/\kappa\)
for \(\lambda_f,k\ge0\). This also proves that the displayed composition
has a bounded extension on the full Hilbert space. Applying \(Q_S\)
to (2.6) now gives the exact local-resolvent equation
\[
Q_S\psi=bR_SW_S\psi.                                          \tag{2.8}
\]

# 3. Local electric moments at every positive coupling

**Theorem 3.1.** For every box \(L\ge2\), every \(a,g_{\rm YM}>0\),
every link \(e\), and every nonempty finite link set \(S\),
\[
\|E_e\psi\|\le2r_e\xi,\qquad
0\le\gamma_e\le\frac{16}{3}r_e^2\xi^2,                         \tag{3.1}
\]
\[
\|Q_S\psi\|\le q_S\xi,\qquad
q_S=\frac83\left(\sum_{e\in S}r_e^2\right)^{1/2}
\le\frac{32}{3}\sqrt{|S|}.                                    \tag{3.2}
\]
The constants have no dependence on the number of exterior links or faces.

**Proof.** Use \(S=\{e\}\) in (2.6). Its local interaction satisfies
\(\|W_S\|\le2r_e\). For the joint nonnegative spectral variables
of \(\kappa E_e\) and \(K_S\), their sum is at least the first
variable. Squaring this scalar inequality and integrating against the
spectral measure of \(\psi\) proves
\[
\kappa\|E_e\psi\|\le\|B_S\psi\|
 =b\|W_e^{\star}\psi\|\le2br_e.
\]
Since each nonzero eigenvalue of \(E_e\) is at least \(3/4\),
the spectral inequality \(E_e\le(4/3)E_e^2\) gives the second bound
in (3.1). The commuting projections onto nonconstant individual link
factors obey \(Q_S\le\sum_{e\in S}Q_{\{e\}}\) in their joint
zero/one eigenvalues. Also \(Q_{\{e\}}\le(16/9)E_e^2\).
Taking expectations and using (3.1) gives
\[
\|Q_S\psi\|^2\le\frac{16}{9}\sum_{e\in S}\|E_e\psi\|^2
 \le\frac{64}{9}\xi^2\sum_{e\in S}r_e^2.
\]
This proves (3.2). All estimates used the actual normalized vacuum;
no estimate on its full-box distance from the constant was used. \(\square\)

For later use, let \(F\) be any bounded multiplication operator depending
only on \(S\), with full Haar mean \(\overline F\). With
\(\eta=P_S\psi,\ u=Q_S\psi,\ q=\|u\|\), Fubini gives
\(\langle\eta,F\eta\rangle=\overline F\|\eta\|^2\).
Expanding all four terms of \(\langle\eta+u,F(\eta+u)\rangle\)
and using \(\|\eta\|^2=1-q^2\) therefore gives
\[
\left|\langle\psi,F\psi\rangle-\overline F\right|
 \le2\|F\|q+2\|F\|q^2.                                      \tag{3.3}
\]
This is a proved bound on a marginal expectation. It does not replace
the marginal by Haar measure.

# 4. An edge-star resolvent with an explicit state-vector remainder

Take
\[
S_e=\bigcup_{p\ni e}\partial p,\qquad m_e^{\star}=m_{S_e}.
\]
Each face at \(e\) adds at most three other links, so
\( |S_e|\le1+3r_e\le13\). Each link meets at most four faces,
hence \(m_e^{\star}\le4|S_e|\le52\). Equation (3.2) gives
\(q_{S_e}\le32\sqrt{13}/3<39\). These counts hold also at every
boundary of the open box.

**Theorem 4.1.** Simultaneously for all links and all boxes, on the explicit
interval \(0<\xi\le1/64\),
\[
\left\|E_e\psi-\frac\xi4W_e^{\star}\psi\right\|
 \le4200\xi^2.                                                 \tag{4.1}
\]
This compares two vectors in the same full interacting Hilbert space.

**Proof.** In Section 2 take \(S=S_e\) and abbreviate its operators
as \(P,Q,K,B,R\). Write \(\eta=P\psi,\ u=Q\psi\), with
\(\|u\|\le q_S\xi\). Applying \(P\) to (2.6) and using (2.4)
gives
\[
K\eta=bPW_Su,\qquad \|K\eta\|\le2bm_Sq_S\xi.                 \tag{4.2}
\]
Since \(E_eP=0\), equation (2.8) gives
\[
E_e\psi=bE_eRW_S\eta+bE_eRW_Su.                               \tag{4.3}
\]
Its second term has norm at most \(2m_Sq_S\xi^2\), by (2.7).
For a face not containing \(e\), \(E_eW_p\eta=0\). For a face
containing \(e\), all four boundary links lie in \(S\), and
\[
E_eW_p\eta=\frac34W_p\eta,\qquad H_SW_p\eta=3W_p\eta.
\]
Here the four fundamental Casimirs contribute separately, with exterior
variables untouched. Multiplication by such \(W_p\) commutes with \(K\).
The bounded map \(\zeta\mapsto W_p\zeta\) from the exterior space
to the local four-fundamental sector intertwines \(3\kappa+K\)
with \(B\). Its image is in \(Q\mathcal H_L\). Resolvent intertwining
and (4.3) thus give the exact identity
\[
bE_eRW_S\eta=\frac{3b}{4}
 W_e^{\star}(3\kappa+K)^{-1}\eta.
\]
The exterior inverse exists because \(K\ge0\). Subtracting
\((\xi/4)W_e^{\star}\eta\), while retaining \(K\), gives
\[
-\frac\xi4W_e^{\star}(3\kappa+K)^{-1}K\eta,
\]
whose norm by (4.2) is at most
\(r_em_Sq_S\xi^3/3\). Replacing \(\eta\) by \(\psi\) in the
comparison term has the additional norm cost
\(r_eq_S\xi^2/2\). We have proved the more detailed bound
\[
\left\|E_e\psi-\frac\xi4W_e^{\star}\psi\right\|
\le (2m_S+r_e/2)q_S\xi^2
       +\frac{r_em_Sq_S}{3}\xi^3
\le4134\xi^2+2704\xi^3.                                      \tag{4.4}
\]
For \(\xi\le1/64\) the last coefficient is
\(4134+2704/64=16705/4<4200\). This proves (4.1).
Equations (4.2)--(4.4) exhibit every discarded-in-an-estimate term
as an exact retained term with a bound; none is set to zero. \(\square\)

# 5. Uniform local Wilson and connected electric covariances

For elementary faces \(p,q\), Haar integration gives
\(\int W_pW_qdU=\delta_{pq}\). For unequal faces a link occurs in
only one support; its central sign change annihilates the integral.
For equal faces Haar invariance reduces the integral to
\(\int_{SU(2)}(\operatorname{tr}U)^2dU=1\). In quaternion coordinates
the latter is \(4\int u_0^2=1\), since the four coordinate second
moments on the unit three-sphere equal \(1/4\).

The function \(W_pW_q\) has norm at most \(4\) and uses at most eight
links. Equations (3.2)--(3.3), with
\(q_S\le32\sqrt8/3<31\), prove, for \(0<\xi\le1/64\),
\[
|\langle W_pW_q\rangle_\psi-\delta_{pq}|
 \le248\xi+7688\xi^2\le370\xi.                              \tag{5.1}
\]
This remains valid for faces at any separation; no finite-range assertion
about their true correlations is imposed.

For an individual face choose any one boundary link \(e\) and decompose
\(\psi=P_{\{e\}}\psi+Q_{\{e\}}\psi\). The first-first matrix
element of \(W_p\) vanishes by integration over \(e\). Equation (3.2)
gives \(q\le32\xi/3\), and the other three terms give
\[
|\langle W_p\rangle_\psi|\le4q+2q^2
 \le\left(\frac{128}{3}+\frac{32}{9}\right)\xi<47\xi.
\]
Consequently the connected Wilson moment obeys
\[
|\langle W_pW_q\rangle_\psi
 -\langle W_p\rangle_\psi\langle W_q\rangle_\psi-\delta_{pq}|
 \le410\xi.                                                   \tag{5.2}
\]
Indeed (5.1) and \(47^2\xi^2\le(2209/64)\xi\) give a smaller
constant than \(410\).

**Theorem 5.1.** On the same interval, simultaneously for all boxes and links,
\[
\left|C_{ef}-\frac{\xi^2}{16}t_{ef}\right|\le42500\xi^3.       \tag{5.3}
\]

**Proof.** Set \(u_e=E_e\psi\) and
\(a_e=(\xi/4)W_e^{\star}\psi\). The preceding bounds give
\[
\|u_e\|\le8\xi,\quad \|a_e\|\le2\xi,\quad
\|u_e-a_e\|\le4200\xi^2.
\]
Using the exact difference
\(\langle u_e-a_e,u_f\rangle+\langle a_e,u_f-a_f\rangle\),
its absolute value is at most \(42000\xi^3\). Also
\[
\langle a_e,a_f\rangle
 =\frac{\xi^2}{16}\sum_{p\ni e,q\ni f}\langle W_pW_q\rangle_\psi.
\]
There are at most sixteen ordered pairs in this sum. Its difference
from \(\xi^2t_{ef}/16\) is at most \(370\xi^3\), by (5.1).
Finally (3.1) bounds the exact centering term by
\[
|\gamma_e\gamma_f|\le\frac{65536}{9}\xi^4
 \le\frac{1024}{9}\xi^3<114\xi^3.
\]
The sum \(42000+370+114=42484<42500\) proves (5.3).
No odd Taylor coefficient has been asserted nonzero: this is an
absolute real-coupling remainder bound. The fixed-box evenness theorem
is compatible with (5.3); without an additional uniform analytic
argument it does not improve this bound to order \(\xi^4\). \(\square\)

# 6. Energy entries and a volume-independent weighted numerator estimate

Put \(A=H-\mathcal E\). The product rule, with the original sign
of \(E_f\), gives on the smooth vacuum
\[
AE_f\psi=[H,E_f]\psi
=b\left(\frac34W_f^{\star}\psi-2D_f\psi\right),\qquad
D_f\psi=\sum_{p\ni f,a}(X_{f,a}W_p)X_{f,a}\psi.                \tag{6.1}
\]
The electric sum commutes with \(E_f\). The potential contribution is
\(b[E_f,W_f^{\star}]\), retaining its first-derivative term in full.

For any one occurrence of a link in a simple Wilson loop, cyclically
basing the holonomy at that occurrence writes its derivative as
\(\operatorname{tr}(T_aU)\), or its negative, with a possible adjoint
rotation of the index \(a\). Quaternion coordinates then give
\[
\sum_a|X_{f,a}W_p|^2=1-W_p^2/4\le1.                           \tag{6.2}
\]
Pointwise Cauchy--Schwarz, followed by integration, bounds each
plaquette contraction in \(D_f\psi\) by
\((\sum_a\|X_{f,a}\psi\|^2)^{1/2}=\sqrt{\gamma_f}\).
Thus (3.1) gives
\[
\|D_f\psi\|\le r_f\sqrt{\gamma_f}
 \le\frac4{\sqrt3}r_f^2\xi\le\frac{64}{\sqrt3}\xi<37\xi.     \tag{6.3}
\]

**Theorem 6.1.** For \(0<\xi\le1/64\), all boxes, and all links,
\[
\left|\mathcal N_{ef}-\frac{3\kappa\xi^2}{16}t_{ef}\right|
 \le27000\kappa\xi^3.                                        \tag{6.4}
\]
For every real edge weight \(w\), including weights depending on \(L\)
and \(\xi\),
\[
\left|w^T\mathcal Nw-\frac{3\kappa\xi^2}{16}\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\right|
 \le351000\kappa\xi^3\|w\|_2^2,\qquad
 (\mathsf Iw)_p=\sum_{e\in\partial p}w_e.                     \tag{6.5}
\]

**Proof.** Since \(A\psi=0\), centering does not change
\(\mathcal N_{ef}=\langle E_e\psi,AE_f\psi\rangle\).
Insert (6.1). Replacing \(E_e\psi\) by \(a_e\) in the first term
costs at most \(6\cdot4200\kappa\xi^3=25200\kappa\xi^3\),
because \(\|W_f^{\star}\psi\|\le8\). The comparison of its
remaining Wilson products to Haar costs at most \(1110\kappa\xi^3\)
by (5.1). The full derivative term is at most
\(2\kappa\xi(8\xi)(37\xi)=592\kappa\xi^3\).
Their sum is \(26902\kappa\xi^3<27000\kappa\xi^3\), proving (6.4).

To prove the weighted conclusion without extending the entry bound
to an unjustified operator bound, expand the double commutator:
\[
\mathcal N_{ef}
 =\tfrac12\langle\psi,[E_e,[H,E_f]]\psi\rangle
 =\frac b2\sum_{p:e,f\in\partial p}
 \langle\psi,[E_e,[2-W_p,E_f]]\psi\rangle.                     \tag{6.6}
\]
The first identity follows from commutation of \(E_e,E_f\), the
vacuum equation at both endpoints, and reality of the two equal
cross terms. In the second, a face absent from \(f\) has zero inner
commutator. A face containing \(f\) but absent from \(e\) has
coefficients and derivatives commuting with \(E_e\). This proves
exact support on shared faces. A link has at most \(1+3r_e\le13\)
partners, counting itself. The remainder in (6.4) has the same support.
For its real symmetric matrix \(R\),
\[
|w^TRw|\le\sum_{e,f}|R_{ef}|\frac{w_e^2+w_f^2}{2}
 \le13\cdot27000\kappa\xi^3\sum_ew_e^2.
\]
Finally \(t=\mathsf I^T\mathsf I\) by its definition. This proves
(6.5), with no factor of \(M\), \(N\), or \(L\) in its constant. \(\square\)

# 7. Actual states, arbitrary weights, and the entire leading kernel

For real \(w\) write
\(\Gamma_w=\sum_ew_eE_e,\ v_w=(\Gamma_w-\langle\Gamma_w\rangle_\psi)\psi\).
These operators and states preserve the gauge constraint; all products
are taken on smooth \(\psi\). Equations (5.3) and (6.5) give simultaneously
\[
\left|\|v_w\|^2-\frac{\xi^2}{16}\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\right|
 \le42500\xi^3\|w\|_1^2,                                    \tag{7.1}
\]
\[
\left|\mathfrak q_A[v_w]-\frac{3\kappa\xi^2}{16}\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\right|
 \le351000\kappa\xi^3\|w\|_2^2.                              \tag{7.2}
\]
The \(\ell^1\) norm in (7.1) is not replaced by an \(\ell^2\) norm.
The long-distance covariance entries are retained. Equations (7.1)--(7.2)
are genuine full-vacuum inequalities at fixed nonzero coupling, not
coefficients interpreted outside a finite-box perturbation disk.
Section 12 proves an additional \(\ell^2\) upper bound by a convergent
full-vacuum cluster construction. Sections 13--14 subsequently prove
absolute distance decay and the stronger two-sided \(\ell^2\) remainder
(14.5). Equation (7.1) remains valid on its original larger interval.

On the entire real kernel \(\mathsf Iw=0\), a sharper order statement
follows from the vector calculation. Summing (4.1) gives exactly
\(\Gamma_w\psi=\sum_ew_e(E_e\psi-a_e)\), since
\(\sum_ew_eW_e^{\star}=\sum_p(\mathsf Iw)_pW_p=0\).
Projection perpendicular to \(\psi\) is a contraction, so
\[
\|v_w\|^2\le17640000\xi^4\|w\|_1^2.                          \tag{7.3}
\]
In the sum of (6.1), the same cancellation gives
\(A\Gamma_w\psi=-2b\sum_ew_eD_e\psi\).
Using (6.3) and (4.1), without dividing by a possibly small state norm,
proves
\[
0\le\mathfrak q_A[v_w]\le310800\kappa\xi^4\|w\|_1^2.         \tag{7.4}
\]
The constants are \(4200^2=17640000\) and \(2\cdot4200\cdot37=310800\).
These estimates preserve the already calculated nonzero fourth-order
kernel forms. They do not assert a new lower bound on those forms.
The uniform fourth-order identification and a positive lower bound on
the entire incidence kernel are proved below in (16.21)--(16.24),
using the retained coefficients and a smaller explicit coupling interval.

There is also a uniform, quantitative local Rayleigh result. For any single
link \(e\) and
\[
0<\xi\le\frac1{680000},                                      \tag{7.5}
\]
(5.3), \(r_e\ge2\), and \(42500/680000=1/16\) give
\[
C_{ee}\ge\frac{r_e}{32}\xi^2>0.
\]
Equations (5.3) and (6.4) therefore imply
\[
\left|\frac{\mathfrak q_A[v_e]}{\|v_e\|^2}-3\kappa\right|
 \le\frac{4944000}{r_e}\kappa\xi
 \le2472000\kappa\xi.                                       \tag{7.6}
\]
The numerator in this calculation satisfies
\(|\mathcal N_{ee}-3\kappa C_{ee}|\le154500\kappa\xi^3\),
which supplies the constant in (7.6). This is the energy of the actual
smooth nonzero gauge-invariant local trial vector. By the spectral
variational principle its quotient is an upper bound on the physical
finite-box excitation gap, not a lower bound on that gap.
The explicit range (7.5) is equivalently
\(g_{\rm YM}^4\ge170000\), retaining \(\xi=1/(4g_{\rm YM}^4)\).
Neither \(a\) nor \(L\) appears in this range.
Section 15 proves the matching volume-uniform lower threshold for the
physical operator and every nonzero signed electric state; together they
bound the attained minimum over the entire actual electric-state family.

# 8. Propagation to the original native magnetic state

For the unchanged \(n_2^2\) weights in (1.4), set
\[
\mathcal A_L=\frac{L^2(2L+1)}{15}
 (24L^4+24L^3+8L^2-4L+3),
\]
\[
S_{1,L}=\frac{2L^2(L+1)(2L+1)^2}{3},\qquad
S_{2,L}=\frac{2L^2(L+1)(2L+1)^2(3L^2+3L-1)}{15}.
\]
The exact identities are
\(\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|_2^2=4\mathcal A_L\),
\(\|w^{\rm nat}\|_1=S_{1,L}\), and
\(\|w^{\rm nat}\|_2^2=S_{2,L}\). To check them with all boundary
terms, direction-1 links have \(2L\) first coordinates and \(2L+1\)
third coordinates, so the latter two sums are
\(2L(2L+1)\sum_{t=-L}^Lt^2\) and
\(2L(2L+1)\sum_{t=-L}^Lt^4\).
The exact sums are
\(L(L+1)(2L+1)/3\) and
\(L(L+1)(2L+1)(3L^2+3L-1)/15\), respectively; their formulas follow
by taking the difference under \(L\mapsto L+1\) and checking \(L=0\).
For face sums the \(12\) profile is \(t^2+(t+1)^2\), the \(13\)
profile is \(2t^2\), and the \(23\) profile is zero. Counting their
allowed lower corners gives
\[
\mathcal A_L=2L(2L+1)\sum_{t=-L}^{L-1}(t^2+t+1/2)^2
                  +4L^2\sum_{t=-L}^{L}t^4.
\]
The first sum is \(L(4L^4+1)/10\), checked by the two added endpoint
terms and its value at \(L=1\); substitution gives the displayed polynomial.

Equations (7.1)--(7.2) now yield the explicit new remainders
\[
\left|\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2-\frac{\xi^2}{4}\mathcal A_L\right|
 \le42500\xi^3 S_{1,L}^2,                                    \tag{8.1}
\]
\[
\left|\mathfrak q_A[v_{w^{\rm nat}}]
          -\frac{3\kappa\xi^2}{4}\mathcal A_L\right|
 \le351000\kappa\xi^3 S_{2,L}.                               \tag{8.2}
\]
All native weights are nonnegative, so on each face
\((\sum w_e)^2\ge\sum w_e^2\); summing faces gives
\(4\mathcal A_L\ge\sum_e r_e(w_e^{\rm nat})^2\ge2S_{2,L}\).
Consequently the relative error in the native energy numerator is at most
\(936000\xi\), independently of \(L\). In particular on
\(0<\xi\le1/1872000\) it is at most one half of that numerator's
positive leading term. This is a proved fixed-coupling extensive energy
estimate, not a volume-shrinking perturbative statement.

The upper error-to-leading-term ratio furnished by (8.1) alone
is \(170000\xi S_{1,L}^2/\mathcal A_L\). Its \(L^3\) growth is
visible in the exact polynomials. This bound does not give a uniform
relative error for the native denominator. No step through Section 8 proves
summability of the separated electric correlations, and the
fourth-order leading kernel is not discarded. The proved local covariance
and weighted numerator estimates therefore do not yet establish the
fixed-coupling minimum over every extensive weight or its continuum limit.
This statement records the scope of the inequalities actually proved;
it is not an assertion that the remaining correlations have no relation
to the native state.
Sections 11--12 below prove a uniform full spectral lower bound and
an extensive covariance upper bound on an explicit smaller nonempty
interval. Sections 13--14 then prove a uniform two-sided remainder
by controlling the separated correlations. In particular (14.8) replaces
the \(L^3\) relative loss by the explicitly vanishing \(8\epsilon_\xi\),
and (14.7) applies to the native electric-state quotient. These later
estimates do not change the original coefficients in (8.1)--(8.2).
The gauge-equivariant calculation in Section 15 additionally proves the
uniform signed-state minimum (15.21) and improves the native extensive
upper bound to (15.17); the stronger lower threshold is not obtained by
discarding a small native or signed covariance denominator.

The full physical coefficient conversions are
\[
\xi^2=\frac1{16g_{\rm YM}^8},\quad
\xi^3=\frac1{64g_{\rm YM}^{12}},\quad
\kappa\xi^2=\frac1{8g_{\rm YM}^6a},\quad
\kappa\xi^3=\frac1{32g_{\rm YM}^{10}a}.
\]
Thus, for example, the right side of (8.2) is exactly
\(351000S_{2,L}/(32g_{\rm YM}^{10}a)\).
The actual vacuum energy includes \(2bM=M/(g_{\rm YM}^2a)\)
throughout. The proof does not exchange any spatial, coupling, cusp,
or continuum limits.

# 9. Primary literature, exact dictionaries, and provenance

The local projection method is related to the Feshbach--Schur
reconstruction map, not claimed as a new general projection principle.
Dusson--Sigal--Stamm, *The Feshbach--Schur map and perturbation theory*,
arXiv:2105.02058v1, Theorem 1.2, equation (1.11), and Lemma 2.1 give
the complement inverse and eigenvector reconstruction mechanism
([primary source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02058)). Their finite-rank
perturbation theorem is not used as a volume-uniform hypothesis.
Here \(P=P_S\) has infinite rank when the exterior is nonempty.
For an exact operator dictionary, set
\[
A_S^Q=Q_S(H-\mathcal E)Q_S|_{Q_S\mathcal H_L}
 =B_S|_{Q_S\mathcal H_L}-bQ_SW_SQ_S.
\]
On its domain, when \(2m_S\xi<3/4\), the bound
\(A_S^Q\ge\kappa(3/4-2m_S\xi)>0\) proves its bounded inverse.
The \(Q_S\) block of the full eigen-equation gives exactly
\[
Q_S\psi=b(A_S^Q)^{-1}Q_SW_SP_S\psi.                            \tag{9.1}
\]
The retained block is then
\[
\left[K_S-b^2P_SW_SQ_S(A_S^Q)^{-1}Q_SW_SP_S\right]P_S\psi=0.   \tag{9.2}
\]
Equations (9.1)--(9.2) follow directly by substitution, including the
minus sign and complete exterior operator. Their domains are the
exterior domain of \(K_S\) and its image under the bounded reconstruction
correction. The off-diagonal factors are bounded, so the effective
correction in (9.2) is bounded on the exterior Hilbert space.
Conversely a vector in that domain solving (9.2), inserted into (9.1),
lies in the full domain and solves the original zero-eigenvalue equation.
Applying \(P_S\) to this reconstruction recovers the original exterior
vector; its kernel is therefore zero. This proves the exact bijection
of the two kernels. The estimates in Sections 3--8 instead use (2.8),
whose inverse needs no smallness condition on \(b\); (9.1) explains the
precise relation between the two complement-resolvent presentations.

The canonical corpus also routes Henheik--Teufel--Wessel, *Local stability
of ground states in locally gapped and weakly interacting quantum spin
systems*, arXiv:2106.13780v3, Section 2 and Theorem 7
([primary source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13780)). It permits
infinite-dimensional single-site spaces and unbounded on-site operators.
Its locality constants are existential in the statements read; none is
assigned a numerical value in this note.
The exact model dictionary can be given without changing physical
coordinates. Associate the edge \((n,i)\) to the indexing site
\(x(e)=2n+\mathbf e_i\in\mathbb Z^3\), retaining this map's inverse
on its image: the unique odd coordinate identifies \(i\), and then
\(n=(x-\mathbf e_i)/2\). Attach \(L^2(SU(2))\) and on-site
\(h_{x(e)}=\kappa E_e\) to that site. The on-site gap is
\(3\kappa/4\). Assign a face \(p=(n;i,j)\), \(i<j\), to
its edge \((n,i)\). Its other three indexing sites have \(\ell^1\)
distance \(2\) from \(x(n,i)\). At most two faces are assigned to one
edge, so
\(\Phi_{x(e)}=b\sum_{p\ {\rm assigned\ to}\ e}(2-W_p)\)
has norm at most \(8b\) and range \(2\).
The tensor-permutation unitary defined on elementary tensor functions
by this bijection intertwines the complete Hamiltonian with
\(\sum_xh_x+\sum_x\Phi_x\), including all scalar terms.
The indexing map is not a physical rescaling: the original midpoint is
exactly \(a\,x(e)/2\). The source's small-interaction theorem is not
invoked to supply the explicit constants (3.1)--(8.2); those were proved
above for this precise model.

The local source identities and conventions were read in full in:

- `magnetic_translation_true_vacuum.md`, Sections 1--9, especially
  (1.1), (1.4), (5.3), and (8.1)--(8.5);
- `local_energy_current_true_vacuum.md`, Sections 1--6;
- `wilson_variation/ELECTRIC_COVARIANCE_UNSIGNED_INCIDENCE_20260908.md`,
  Sections 1--8, especially (2.8)--(2.9), (5.7), (6.5), and (7.13);
- `wilson_variation/BULK_PLAQUETTE_EXTENSION.md`, Sections 1--10,
  especially the explicit box-dependent disk and conditional-form maps.

Their common root is `../ym_gap_primary_20260908`.
The complete finite incidence-kernel and second-order coefficient
calculations are preserved there. This note does not repeat those
calculations or promote their \(O_L\) constants to uniform ones.
Its new input to that chain is the independently proved quantitative
local-resolvent control and the resulting estimates above.
The machine-readable lane route records the canonical query results,
primary TeX locators, exact reading coverage, and remaining source reads.

# 10. A uniform score bound and coercivity of the actual conditional operator

The full vacuum equation also controls the conditional density without a
small-coupling expansion. This gives a second volume-independent estimate
useful in the exact elimination construction. It does not presuppose a
spectral gap for the full interacting system.

Use the product Riemannian metric for which the three \(T_a\) fields at
each link are orthonormal; write \(\nabla_e,\Delta_e\) for its link
gradient and Laplacian, and \(\Delta=\sum_e\Delta_e=-\sum_eE_e\).
This is precisely the metric already used in (1.2), not a new physical
metric. In quaternion coordinates \(U=u_0I+i\sum_a u_a\sigma_a\), its
metric is four times the metric of the unit three-sphere: the tangent
vector \(T_a\) at the identity has quaternion Euclidean length \(1/2\),
while its specified Riemannian length is 1. Left multiplication is
orthogonal on quaternions, so this identity holds at every point.
Consequently a link factor is isometric to the round sphere of radius 2.
Its sectional curvature is \(1/4\), Ricci tensor is \(g/2\), and diameter
is \(2\pi\). The curvature coefficient also follows from the second
fundamental form of the radius-2 sphere: its normal derivative has
magnitude \(1/2\), the Gauss equation gives sectional curvature \(1/4\),
and summing the two transverse sectional curvatures gives \(1/2\).
These computations retain the factor four relative to \(c\).

Put \(u=\log\psi\), a globally smooth real function because \(\psi>0\).
Dividing the eigen-equation by the same positive \(\psi\), with its
original unit norm left unchanged, yields the exact nonlinear equation
\[
\Delta u+|\nabla u|^2=\frac{V-\mathcal E}{\kappa},
\qquad V=b\sum_{p\in\mathsf P_L}(2-W_p).                         \tag{10.1}
\]
For each fixed link \(e\) define \(w_e=|\nabla_eu|^2\), and let
\(\nabla_f\nabla_eu\) denote the covariant derivative, in factor \(f\),
of the factor-\(e\) gradient. On the product manifold the partial
Bochner identity is
\[
\Delta w_e
=2\sum_f|\nabla_f\nabla_eu|_{\rm HS}^2
 +2\langle\nabla_eu,\nabla_e\Delta u\rangle+w_e.                  \tag{10.2}
\]
Here is its coordinate derivation. Take orthonormal geodesic frames
in every factor at the point under consideration. Applying each
second derivative in \(\Delta_f\) to the sum of squares of the three
components of \(\nabla_eu\) gives twice their squared first derivatives
plus twice their contraction with the second derivative of the vector.
For \(f\ne e\), the product connection has zero mixed curvature, so that
second derivative commutes with \(\nabla_e\). For \(f=e\), commuting
the covariant derivatives of the differential \(du\) gives
\[
\Delta_e^{\rm rough}\nabla_eu
=\nabla_e\Delta_eu+\operatorname{Ric}_e(\nabla_eu).
\]
This sign can equally be read from the positive sectional-curvature
Gauss formula above. The Ricci contraction in the differentiated norm
is \(2\operatorname{Ric}_e(\nabla_eu,\nabla_eu)=w_e\).
Adding the factor equations proves (10.2).
The scalar smooth Bochner identity, with the same sign of \(\Delta\),
is given in C. Villani, *Optimal Transport: Old and New*, Chapter 14,
equation (14.28), printed p.388 (PDF p.394 in the indexed local edition).
The partial-factor and vacuum substitutions used here are calculated
explicitly, rather than inferred from a dimension-independent constant
not stated there.

Let \(\mathcal D_u=\Delta+2\langle\nabla u,\nabla\,\cdot\,\rangle\).
Differentiating (10.1) and using the symmetry of the full Hessian gives
\[
\mathcal D_u w_e
=2\sum_f|\nabla_f\nabla_eu|_{\rm HS}^2+w_e
 +\frac2\kappa\langle\nabla_eu,\nabla_eV\rangle.                 \tag{10.3}
\]
In detail, the derivative of \(|\nabla u|^2\) in factor \(e\)
is \(2(\nabla^2u\,\nabla u)_e\). Its contraction with \(2\nabla_eu\)
in (10.2) is minus \(4\nabla^2u(\nabla u,\nabla_eu)\).
The drift applied to \(w_e\) is plus that same quantity. This proves
the cancellation with every mixed factor \(f\) included.

**Theorem 10.1.** For all \(L\ge2\), \(a,g_{\rm YM}>0\), and each link,
\[
\|\nabla_e\log\psi\|_\infty\le2r_e\xi,\qquad
\|\nabla_e\log\rho\|_\infty\le4r_e\xi,\qquad \rho=\psi^2.        \tag{10.4}
\]
In particular
\[
0\le\gamma_e\le4r_e^2\xi^2.                                   \tag{10.5}
\]
This improves the constant in the earlier valid bound (3.1).
All estimates (4.1)--(8.2) remain valid with their displayed constants.

**Proof.** Equation (6.2) gives \(|\nabla_eW_p|\le1\) for every
face at \(e\), and all other face derivatives vanish. Thus
\(|\nabla_eV|\le br_e\), without any factor \(M\).
The smooth nonnegative function \(w_e\) attains its maximum on the
compact product. At that point its full gradient vanishes and
\(\Delta w_e\le0\). Equation (10.3) therefore gives
\[
0\ge w_e-2r_e\xi\sqrt{w_e}.
\]
If the maximum is zero the conclusion is immediate. Otherwise dividing
by its positive square root gives \(\sqrt{w_e}\le2r_e\xi\).
This proves the first bound everywhere. Since \(\log\rho=2u\), the
second follows with its exact factor two. Finally integration by parts
gives
\(\gamma_e=\int|\nabla_e\psi|^2dU=\int\rho|\nabla_eu|^2dU\);
its probability integral and (10.4) prove (10.5). \(\square\)

To apply this to the actual conditional operator, fix a nonempty set
\(S\) of eliminated links and write \(r=U_{S^c}\), \(s=U_S\). Define
\[
\rho_{S^c}(r)=\int\rho(s,r)\,ds,\qquad
p_S(s\mid r)=\frac{\rho(s,r)}{\rho_{S^c}(r)},\qquad
\omega_S=8\pi\xi\sum_{e\in S}r_e.                              \tag{10.6}
\]
These are the marginal and conditional density of the same vacuum,
not a postulated Wilson Gibbs density. Holding \(r\) fixed and joining
two \(S\)-configurations one link at a time by minimizing geodesics,
(10.4) and the diameter \(2\pi\) give
\[
\sup_s\log p_S(s\mid r)-\inf_s\log p_S(s\mid r)\le\omega_S.      \tag{10.7}
\]
The denominator in (10.6) cancels from this oscillation. No differentiability
or uniform limit of the exterior marginal is assumed.

The product Haar Poincare inequality on \(S\), with its exact
single-link spectral coefficient, is
\[
\inf_{c\in\mathbb C}\int|F-c|^2ds
\le\frac43\sum_{e\in S}\int|\nabla_eF|^2ds.                     \tag{10.8}
\]
To prove it, expand \(F\) in the complete product matrix-coefficient
basis used in Section 2. Removing the constant leaves at least one
nonzero spin, so its total electric eigenvalue is at least \(3/4\).
Parseval gives (10.8) first for finite sums and then by form closure
for every \(H^1\) function.
For each exterior \(r\), let \(p_{\max},p_{\min}\) be the maximum
and minimum of its smooth positive conditional density on \(S\).
Minimize over \(c\), first bound the density above, apply (10.8), and
then bound it below in the energy integral. This gives the full
comparison calculation
\[
\begin{split}
\operatorname{Var}_{p_S(\cdot\mid r)}(F)
&\le p_{\max}\inf_c\int|F-c|^2ds\\
&\le\frac{4p_{\max}}3\sum_{e\in S}\int|\nabla_eF|^2ds\\
&\le\frac43 e^{\omega_S}
       \sum_{e\in S}\int|\nabla_eF|^2p_S(s\mid r)\,ds .
\end{split}                                                   \tag{10.9}
\]
The minimum characterization of variance is valid for complex functions
as well, with the complex mean as minimizer. This proof records the
entire density ratio; it is the bounded-density perturbation argument,
not a replacement of either measure.

Let \(\mathscr H_\rho=L^2(\rho\,dU)\), and define the exact isometry
\[
J_S:L^2(\rho_{S^c}\,dr)\longrightarrow\mathscr H_\rho,\qquad
(J_SF)(s,r)=F(r).
\]
Its adjoint is
\[
(J_S^*G)(r)=\int G(s,r)p_S(s\mid r)\,ds.
\]
Fubini verifies the inner-product identity for the adjoint and
\(J_S^*J_S=I\). Thus
\(P_S^\rho=J_SJ_S^*\) and \(Q_S^\rho=I-P_S^\rho\) are
orthogonal projections; \(\mathscr K_S^\rho=\ker J_S^*\)
is the conditional-mean-zero space. The multiplication map
\(U_\psi:G\mapsto\psi G\) is a unitary \(\mathscr H_\rho\to\mathcal H_L\).
The exact ground-state transform and its closed form are
\[
\mathscr L_\rho=U_\psi^{-1}(H-\mathcal E)U_\psi
 =-\kappa(\Delta+\langle\nabla\log\rho,\nabla\,\cdot\,\rangle),
\qquad
q_\rho[G]=\kappa\sum_e\int|\nabla_eG|^2\rho\,dU.                 \tag{10.10}
\]
At each fixed box the density and its reciprocal are smooth and bounded
on a compact space. Differentiating the conditional integral shows that
\(P_S^\rho,Q_S^\rho\) preserve \(H^1\): a retained derivative gives the
conditional integral of the input derivative and a bounded smooth
derivative of the conditional kernel; an eliminated derivative of the
output is zero. The constants in this domain-preservation statement
need not be uniform, and are not used for the coercivity bound below.
Applying \(Q_S^\rho\) to smooth \(H^1\) approximants proves that
\(H^1\cap\mathscr K_S^\rho\) is the form closure of its smooth elements
and dense in \(\mathscr K_S^\rho\).

Define \(C_S^\rho\) as the self-adjoint operator of the restricted
closed form \(q_\rho|_{H^1\cap\mathscr K_S^\rho}\). Explicitly its
domain consists of those \(G\) in that form space for which there is
\(h\in\mathscr K_S^\rho\) satisfying
\(q_\rho(F,G)=\langle F,h\rangle_\rho\) for every \(F\) in the form
space, and \(C_S^\rho G=h\). This definition makes no unproved claim
about the domain of a formal operator product.

**Theorem 10.2.** For every positive coupling and every finite box,
\[
C_S^\rho\ge\frac{3\kappa}{4}e^{-\omega_S}I,\qquad
\|(C_S^\rho)^{-1}\|\le\frac4{3\kappa}e^{\omega_S}.              \tag{10.11}
\]
In particular for a single eliminated link \(e\),
\[
C_{\{e\}}^\rho\ge\frac{3\kappa}{4}e^{-8\pi r_e\xi}I
\ge\frac{3\kappa}{4}e^{-32\pi\xi}I.                            \tag{10.12}
\]
These single-link bounds are independent of all exterior volume and
valid for the actual interacting conditional density.

**Proof.** A vector \(G\in\mathscr K_S^\rho\) has zero conditional
mean for almost every \(r\). Apply (10.9) to its conditional slices
and multiply by \(\rho_{S^c}(r)\); integrate in \(r\). Fubini gives
\[
\|G\|_\rho^2\le\frac43 e^{\omega_S}
       \sum_{e\in S}\int|\nabla_eG|^2\rho\,dU
\le\frac4{3\kappa}e^{\omega_S}q_\rho[G].
\]
Smooth approximation extends this inequality to the entire restricted
form domain. The form representation and spectral theorem yield
(10.11); \(r_e\le4\) gives (10.12).
The unitary \(U_\psi\) carries this form onto the full physical
excitation form restricted to \(U_\psi\mathscr K_S^\rho\), so the
constant has not been transferred between different operators without
a domain map. Gauge transformations preserve the density and intertwine
conditional integration by endpoint Haar invariance. Consequently these
projections, forms, and inverses preserve the physical gauge-invariant
subspaces as well. \(\square\)

For comparison with the original parameters, the last bound in (10.12) is
\[
\frac{3g_{\rm YM}^2}{2a}
       \exp\!\left(-\frac{8\pi}{g_{\rm YM}^4}\right).
\]
For larger eliminated sets the bound is also explicit, but its dependence
on \(\sum_{e\in S}r_e\) is retained. No volume-independent extensive-block
bound is inferred by deleting that sum.
Nor does a uniform conditional one-link gap alone tensorize into a
uniform gap for the correlated full density. The proof has established
an inverse for the actual eliminated operator, not a separated-correlation
estimate or the Millennium spectral conclusion.
The full finite-box spectral bound proved in Section 12 uses an
independently convergent cluster construction, not an assumed
tensorization of these conditional inequalities.

# 11. An explicit convergent cluster coordinate construction for the full vacuum

The source method used here is the commuting creation-coordinate construction
in D. A. Yarotsky, *Quasi-particles in weak perturbations of non-interacting
quantum lattice systems*, arXiv:math-ph/0411042v1, Section 2, equations
labelled mmo, c1, vsum, thl and sumj in the retained source TeX
([primary source](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0411042)).
That section explicitly permits infinite-dimensional single-site spaces
and unbounded on-site operators. Its smallness constants are not numerical.
The following proof derives its own constants for the complete four-link
Wilson interaction. The method is not claimed new. No finite-spin
truncation is made, and no rescaling of the original Hamiltonian or
vacuum is made.

Write
\[
H_0=\kappa\sum_eE_e,\qquad V_p=-bW_p,\qquad
H=H_0+2bM+\sum_pV_p,\qquad \gamma=\frac{3\kappa}{4}.
                                                               \tag{11.1}
\]
Thus \(\|V_p\|\le J:=2b\), each face has \(s=4\) distinct links,
and each link belongs to at most \(d=4\) faces. The scalar \(2bM\)
remains in (11.1) and in the eigenvalue equation below. It commutes with
every coordinate transformation and has zero nonconstant component;
these facts, not deletion of its value, account for its absence from
the nonconstant fixed-point equation.

Let \(\Omega=1\) in the original product Haar probability space. For
\(I\subset\mathsf E_L\), put
\[
\mathcal H'_I=\bigotimes_{e\in I}
       \bigl(L^2(SU(2))\ominus\mathbb C1\bigr),\qquad
\mathcal H'_\varnothing=\mathbb C.
\]
The canonical orthogonal tensor decomposition gives a unitary map
\[
\mathcal T:\bigoplus_{I\subset\mathsf E_L}\mathcal H'_I
 \longrightarrow\mathcal H_L,\qquad
\mathcal T(z)=\sum_I z_I\otimes1_{I^c}.                         \tag{11.2}
\]
Its inverse component \(\Pi_I\) is obtained by Haar integration over
\(I^c\) and application of the nonconstant projection in every link
of \(I\). Product projections prove both inverse identities in (11.2).
For nonempty \(I\), set \(H_I=\kappa\sum_{e\in I}E_e\) on
\(\mathcal H'_I\). The separate nonzero spins prove
\[
H_I\ge\gamma |I|,\qquad
\|H_I^{-1}\|\le(\gamma |I|)^{-1}.                              \tag{11.3}
\]

For \(z_I\in\mathcal H'_I\), define the bounded operator, on the \(I\)
factor and tensored with the exterior identity, by
\[
\widehat z_I f=z_I\langle1_I,f\rangle_{L^2(SU(2)^I)}.
                                                               \tag{11.4}
\]
The inner product is the one fixed in Section 1, so (11.4) is linear
in \(f\). Its norm is \(\|z_I\|\). Integration of any one common
nonconstant link proves
\[
\widehat z_I\widehat y_K=
\begin{cases}
0,&I\cap K\ne\varnothing,\\
\widehat{z_I\otimes y_K},&I\cap K=\varnothing.
\end{cases}                                                   \tag{11.5}
\]
For entangled vectors the same calculation follows by approximation
by finite elementary tensors in \(\mathcal H'_I,\mathcal H'_K\);
operator norms converge by (11.4). In particular all these operators
commute. A product of more than \(N=|\mathsf E_L|\) nonempty
creation operators is zero.

Use the graph whose vertices are physical links and whose distinct
vertices are adjacent precisely when they share a face. For nonempty
\(I\), let \(\ell(I)\) be the smallest number of edges of a connected
subgraph containing \(I\); extra vertices are allowed. The finite
full-box graph is connected. Define
\[
\omega(I)=2^{\ell(I)+1}.
\]
Monotonicity under inclusion holds. For a face support \(p=\partial p\)
the induced graph is a four-vertex clique, so \(\ell(p)=3\) and
\(\omega(p)=16\). If each \(I_j\) meets \(p\), connected minimizing
subgraphs and a tree on \(p\) have connected union. Therefore
\[
\omega\left(p\cup\bigcup_{j=1}^n I_j\right)
 \le16\prod_{j=1}^n\omega(I_j).                               \tag{11.6}
\]
No replacement of physical coordinates is involved in this graph.

Take the Banach space of collections \(z=(z_I)_{I\ne\varnothing}\),
\(z_I\in\operatorname{Dom}(H_I)\), with norm
\[
\|z\|_*=\max_x\sum_{I\ni x}
     \omega(I)\frac{\|H_Iz_I\|}{\gamma}.
                                                               \tag{11.7}
\]
There are finitely many \(I\), and each energy norm is complete by
the bounded inverse in (11.3), so (11.7) is complete. In particular,
writing \(a_I=\omega(I)\|z_I\|\), one has
\[
\sup_x\sum_{I\ni x}|I|a_I\le\|z\|_*,
\qquad
\sum_{I:I\cap p\ne\varnothing}a_I\le s\|z\|_* .                \tag{11.8}
\]
Let \(C(z)=\sum_{I\ne\varnothing}\widehat z_I\).
It is bounded in each finite box. Its exponential and inverse are
the finite polynomials \(e^{C(z)}\) and \(e^{-C(z)}\) by (11.5).
On the full domain of \(H_0\),
\[
[H_0,\widehat z_I]=\widehat{H_Iz_I},\qquad
e^{-C(z)}H_0e^{C(z)}
 =H_0+\sum_{I\ne\varnothing}\widehat{H_Iz_I}.                  \tag{11.9}
\]
To check domains, the exterior part of \(H_0\) commutes with (11.4);
the local part annihilates the Haar bra, and its action on the ket
is \(H_Iz_I\). This first proves the commutator on finite spectral
tensors. Its bounded right-hand side extends it to the full graph
domain by approximation. Thus \(C(z)\), its powers, and both
exponentials preserve that domain. The second commutator in (11.9)
vanishes by (11.5), proving the exact conjugation formula.

The fixed-point map is
\[
\mathcal F(z)_I=-H_I^{-1}\Pi_I
  e^{-C(z)}\left(\sum_pV_p\right)e^{C(z)}\Omega,
       \qquad I\ne\varnothing.                              \tag{11.10}
\]
The projection output is an arbitrary vector of \(\mathcal H'_I\);
(11.3) places \(\mathcal F(z)_I\) in the correct operator domain.
We now bound (11.10), including all clusters, rather than assuming
the convergence estimate quoted in the source.

For a fixed face \(p\), expand
\[
e^{-C(z)}V_pe^{C(z)}
 =\sum_{n\ge0}\frac1{n!}
    [\cdots[[V_p,C(z)],C(z)],\ldots,C(z)].
                                                               \tag{11.11}
\]
Only indices \(I_j\) meeting \(p\) contribute: a creation operator
disjoint from \(p\) commutes with \(V_p\) and with all other creation
operators. Every \(n\)-fold nested commutator expands into \(2^n\)
ordered words. A nonzero word has disjoint creation supports on
each side of \(V_p\). Since they all meet the four-link support of
\(V_p\), there are at most four on either side. Thus (11.11)
actually ends at \(n=8\). Infinite exponential sums used below are
upper bounds for this finite exact polynomial.

There is a dimension-independent bound on the tensor-sector sum of
each word acting on \(\Omega\). Outside \(p\), \(V_p\) acts as
identity. A common outside link of two creation supports annihilates
the word, by integrating a nonconstant factor. Otherwise the outside
excitation set is exactly \((\bigcup_jI_j)\setminus p\).
Only the choice of excited links inside \(p\) varies in the output.
There are at most \(2^s=16\) such orthogonal sectors. Cauchy--Schwarz
and (11.4) give
\[
\sum_K\|\Pi_K(\hbox{word})\Omega\|
 \le2^{s/2}J\prod_{j=1}^n\|z_{I_j}\|
 =4J\prod_{j=1}^n\|z_{I_j}\|.                                \tag{11.12}
\]
The argument is unchanged for entangled creation vectors by the
elementary-tensor approximation already used in (11.5).

Each nonempty output sector \(K\) is contained in
\(p\cup\bigcup_jI_j\). To bound the anchored sum for \(x\in K\),
cover its possibilities by \(x\in p\) and \(x\in I_j\).
For the first possibility there are at most \(d\) choices of \(p\);
(11.8) bounds each remaining index sum by \(sR\), where
\(R=\|z\|_*\). For the second, choose \(j\), then \(I_j\ni x\).
At most \(d|I_j|\) faces meet that set; the first inequality in
(11.8) absorbs this full factor \(|I_j|\). Thus the respective
anchored bounds for the product sums are
\[
d(sR)^n,\qquad ndR(sR)^{n-1}.                                \tag{11.13}
\]
The second quantity is zero for \(n=0\).
Combining (11.6), (11.10)--(11.13), and the exact cancellation of
\(H_I\) against its inverse yields
\[
\|\mathcal F(z)\|_*
\le\frac{4Jd\,16}{\gamma}
 \sum_{n\ge0}\frac{2^n}{n!}
       \bigl[(sR)^n+nR(sR)^{n-1}\bigr]
=\frac{2048}{3}\xi(1+2R)e^{8R}.                              \tag{11.14}
\]
This anchor counting, rather than the norm of the full perturbation,
removes the factor \(M\).

For two collections in a ball of radius \(R\), telescope each
multilinear word in (11.11), inserting their difference in one
position at a time. The counting (11.13) holds with the norm of that
difference in its position, whether the anchor is there or elsewhere.
For the homogeneous degree-\(n\) bound this multiplies its coefficient
by \(nR^{n-1}\) instead of \(R^n\). Differentiating the positive
majorant series in (11.14) proves
\[
\|\mathcal F(z)-\mathcal F(y)\|_*
 \le\frac{2048}{3}\xi(10+16R)e^{8R}\|z-y\|_* .                \tag{11.15}
\]
This is a bound on the exact finite commutator map, not on a
truncated approximation to the vacuum.

Set \(R_*=1/16\). Since
\(\sum_{n\ge0}(1/2)^n/n!<\sum_{n\ge0}(1/2)^n=2\), (11.14)--(11.15)
give, on the explicit nonempty interval
\[
0<\xi\le\frac1{49152},                                      \tag{11.16}
\]
\[
\|\mathcal F(z)\|_*\le1536\xi\le\frac1{32}<R_*,
\qquad
\operatorname{Lip}(\mathcal F)\le\frac{45056}{3}\xi
 \le\frac{11}{36}<1.                                       \tag{11.17}
\]
Iteration from zero therefore converges in the complete ball to a
unique fixed point \(z\). More explicitly, successive increments
are bounded by a geometric series of ratio \(11/36\); the limit
solves (11.10) by continuity, and applying (11.15) to two fixed
points proves uniqueness. Complex conjugation preserves the real
Wilson potential, the Haar projections and the inverses \(H_I^{-1}\).
It commutes with the iteration, so \(z\), \(e^{C(z)}\Omega\), and
the eigenvalue below are real.

Equations (11.9)--(11.10) show that
\[
\phi=e^{C(z)}\Omega,\qquad
H\phi=\varepsilon\phi,\qquad
\varepsilon=2bM+
 \Pi_\varnothing e^{-C(z)}\left(\sum_pV_p\right)e^{C(z)}\Omega.
                                                               \tag{11.18}
\]
Every nonempty creation product has zero Haar integral, hence
\(\langle\Omega,\phi\rangle=1\), so \(\phi\ne0\).
The next section proves that \(\varepsilon=\mathcal E\), and identifies
the exact scalar relating \(\phi\) to the unchanged physical unit
vacuum. No equality of these differently specified vectors is presumed.

# 12. Uniform full spectral estimate and the extensive electric covariance

In this section (11.16) holds. Fix its constructed \(z\) and abbreviate
\(C=C(z)\). The bounded invertible similarity
\[
\widetilde H=e^{-C}(H-\varepsilon)e^C=H_0+\mathcal K,\qquad
\widetilde H\Omega=0                                       \tag{12.1}
\]
has the full domain of \(H_0\), by (11.9).
It is not asserted unitary. Both similarities and the exact physical
Hamiltonian, including its ground energy, remain explicit.

Give the finite orthogonal sector decomposition the additional norm
\[
\|f\|_{\oplus,1}=\sum_I\|\Pi_If\|,\qquad
\|f\|\le\|f\|_{\oplus,1}\le2^{N/2}\|f\|.                     \tag{12.2}
\]
The second inequality is Cauchy--Schwarz over all \(2^N\) sectors.
Thus the norm has exactly the same vectors and topology in each
fixed box. The equivalence constant depends on volume; no uniform
claim about that equivalence is used.

For \(u_I\in\operatorname{Dom}(H_I)\), (11.5), (11.9), (12.1)
and \(\widetilde H\Omega=0\) give exactly
\[
\mathcal K\,\widehat u_I\Omega
=e^{-C}\left[\sum_pV_p,\widehat u_I\right]e^C\Omega .
                                                               \tag{12.3}
\]
In detail, commute \(\widetilde H\) with \(\widehat u_I\);
the \(H_0\) commutator supplies \(H_Iu_I\), while the creation
sum in (11.9) commutes with \(\widehat u_I\). For the remaining
term, \(e^C\) commutes with \(\widehat u_I\), proving (12.3).
Faces disjoint from \(I\) have zero commutator, so at most
\(d|I|\) faces remain.

Expand each remaining conjugation as in (11.11). All additional
creation indices still have to meet \(p\): the derivation identity
and commutation with \(\widehat u_I\) allow the nested commutators
to be written as the commutator with \(\widehat u_I\) of the
corresponding conjugated \(V_p\).
The output outside \(p\) now has the fixed excited support
\((I\cup\bigcup_jI_j)\setminus p\), or the word vanishes.
Thus (11.12) applies with an extra factor \(\|u_I\|\).
The commutator with \(\widehat u_I\) contributes two words.
Using \(\sum_{K:K\cap p\ne\varnothing}\|z_K\|\le sR_*\) gives
\[
\|\mathcal K\widehat u_I\Omega\|_{\oplus,1}
\le 8Jd\,|I|\,e^{8R_*}\|u_I\|.
                                                               \tag{12.4}
\]
The bound also applies to the empty component with value zero.
Summing (12.4) and using (11.3) proves the relative operator bound
\[
\|\mathcal Kf\|_{\oplus,1}
\le c_\xi\|H_0f\|_{\oplus,1},\qquad
c_\xi=\frac{512}{3}\xi\le\frac1{288}<1,
       \quad f\in\operatorname{Dom}(H_0).                    \tag{12.5}
\]
Indeed \(8Jd/\gamma=256\xi/3\), and \(e^{8R_*}=e^{1/2}<2\).
The bound on finite spectral tensors extends in the graph norm;
all factors in (12.3) preserve the required domain as proved above.

Here is the resolvent argument with no appeal to a missing uniform
perturbation theorem. On every nonempty sector \(I\),
\(\operatorname{Spec}(H_I)\subset[\gamma|I|,\infty)\).
For real \(t<0\), functional calculus gives
\[
\|\mathcal K(H_0-t)^{-1}\|_{\oplus,1}
 \le c_\xi\sup_{\lambda\ge\gamma}
          \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-t}\le c_\xi<1.
\]
For \(0<t<(1-c_\xi)\gamma\), it gives instead
\[
\|\mathcal K(H_0-t)^{-1}\|_{\oplus,1}
 \le\frac{c_\xi\gamma}{\gamma-t}<1.                           \tag{12.6}
\]
The empty sector causes no term because \(\mathcal K\Omega=0\).
The geometric Neumann series for
\((I+\mathcal K(H_0-t)^{-1})^{-1}\), followed by
\((H_0-t)^{-1}\), is a bounded inverse of \(\widetilde H-t\).
The domain is verified by the resolvent's graph-domain image.
Norm equivalence (12.2) makes it also a bounded inverse in the
original Hilbert space, without changing the numerical spectral
exclusion (12.6). Similarity (12.1) transfers this inverse to
\(H-\varepsilon-t\).

The original \(H\) is self-adjoint, \(\varepsilon\) is its real
eigenvalue, and no spectrum lies below it by the \(t<0\) argument.
Thus \(\varepsilon=\mathcal E\). Its simple positive ground vector
was proved in Section 1. The exact identification is therefore
\[
\psi=\alpha e^C\Omega,\qquad
\alpha=\langle\Omega,\psi\rangle>0,\qquad
\alpha^2\|e^C\Omega\|^2=1.                                  \tag{12.7}
\]
This records the physical scalar and preserves the original unit
vacuum rather than replacing it with a coefficient-normalized vector.
The spectrum above it obeys the explicit volume-independent estimate
\[
(H-\mathcal E)\big|_{\psi^\perp}
 \ge\gamma(1-c_\xi)I
 =\frac{3\kappa}{4}\left(1-\frac{512}{3}\xi\right)I
 \ge\frac{287\kappa}{384}I .                                \tag{12.8}
\]
This follows from (12.6) and the spectral theorem, since the ground
eigenvalue is simple. Restricting the same inequality to the
gauge-invariant subspace retains it, because that closed subspace
reduces \(H\) and contains \(\psi\).
Section 15 proves that the cluster similarity itself intertwines this
constraint. Its restricted free threshold is exactly \(3\kappa\), so
(15.13) improves the physical restriction of (12.8), not the full-space
inequality or the numerical fixed-point constants.
In original parameters its range and last lower bound are
\[
g_{\rm YM}^4\ge12288,\qquad
\frac{287g_{\rm YM}^2}{192a}.
                                                               \tag{12.9}
\]
This is a strong-coupling, fixed-spatial-regulator theorem for the
full interacting finite boxes. No spatial continuum limit or
Millennium conclusion follows by deleting its coupling range.

The spectral estimate has an immediate quantitative consequence for
the previously unresolved extensive covariance upper bound.
Every \(v_w\) in Section 7 is perpendicular to \(\psi\), so the
spectral theorem and (12.8) imply
\[
\|v_w\|^2\le
\frac{4}{3\kappa(1-c_\xi)}\,\mathfrak q_{H-\mathcal E}[v_w].
\]
Combining this with the already proved all-weight estimate (7.2)
gives, for every real weight vector and every box,
\[
0\le w^TCw\le
\frac{\xi^2\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2/4
             +468000\xi^3\|w\|_2^2}{1-512\xi/3}.
                                                               \tag{12.10}
\]
The norm of \(\mathsf I\) is at most 4: on each face,
\((\sum_{e\in\partial p}w_e)^2\le4\sum_{e\in\partial p}w_e^2\);
summing faces and retaining \(r_e\le4\) proves
\(\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\le16\|w\|_2^2\).
Consequently the fully extensive matrix upper bound is
\[
0\le C\le
\frac{4\xi^2+468000\xi^3}{1-512\xi/3}\,I_{\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}}.
                                                               \tag{12.11}
\]
This removes the \(\ell^1\)-squared volume loss from an upper bound
on the exact covariance. This argument alone does not assert the entrywise absolute
row summability of \(C\), or an \(\ell^2\) remainder of order
\(\xi^3\) around \(\xi^2\mathsf I^T\mathsf I/16\).
Positive-semidefinite order and absolute-value entry sums are not
interchanged.
Sections 13--14 prove the separate absolute-row and two-sided claims by
an explicit locality and spectral-filter calculation.

For the original native weights the exact substitution is
\[
\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2\le
\frac{\xi^2\mathcal A_L+468000\xi^3S_{2,L}}{1-512\xi/3}.
                                                               \tag{12.12}
\]
Using \(S_{2,L}\le2\mathcal A_L\), proved in Section 8, yields
\[
\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2\le
\xi^2\mathcal A_L
\frac{1+936000\xi}{1-512\xi/3}.
                                                               \tag{12.13}
\]
Unlike (8.1), this upper control has no \(L^3\) relative loss.
Equation (8.1) remains a valid two-sided remainder with its original
constants; (12.13) supplies a different, stronger extensive upper
control on the nonempty range (11.16).
On the entire leading kernel \(\mathsf Iw=0\), (12.10) also yields
\[
\|v_w\|^2\le\frac{468000\xi^3}{1-512\xi/3}\|w\|_2^2.
                                                               \tag{12.14}
\]
This complements, and does not discard, the fourth-order
\(\ell^1\)-weighted bound (7.3) and the parent's exact fourth-order
calculation. The upper bounds (12.10)--(12.14) alone do not give
a two-sided estimate for the minimum over all signed actual states.
The uniform minimum, as opposed to every individual signed quotient,
is obtained in (15.21) by the gauge-restricted spectral argument.
Equations (15.15)--(15.17) also strengthen these PSD upper bounds by a
factor of four. The original fourth-order kernel coefficients are
retained; (16.21) supplies their uniform covariance and energy remainders.

Finally the same result improves exact extensive elimination, not only
the electric variational family. For every nonempty eliminated set
\(S\), a vector \(G\in\ker J_S^*\) satisfies
\[
\int G\rho\,dU=\int (J_S^*G)(r)\rho_{S^c}(r)\,dr=0.
\]
Thus \(U_\psi G=\psi G\) is perpendicular to the actual ground
vector. Apply (12.8) to its form and use (10.10), first on smooth
vectors and then by the proved form closure. This yields
\[
C_S^\rho\ge\frac{3\kappa}{4}(1-512\xi/3)I
 \ge\frac{287\kappa}{384}I
 \quad\left(0<\xi\le\frac1{49152}\right),                    \tag{12.15}
\]
\[
\|(C_S^\rho)^{-1}\|
 \le\frac{4}{3\kappa(1-512\xi/3)}
 \le\frac{384}{287\kappa}.                                  \tag{12.16}
\]
Every constant in (12.15)--(12.16) is independent of the size,
shape and location of \(S\), as well as the exterior volume.
The operator is precisely the restricted full form \(C_S^\rho\)
defined in Section 10, containing derivatives in all link directions.
It is not replaced by a conditional-fibre differential operator
containing only eliminated derivatives. The all-positive-coupling
bound (10.11) remains available outside (11.16). On their common
range both lower bounds hold, so the larger of the two constants
may be used. The unitary and gauge maps remain exactly those
proved in Section 10.

For the reducing gauge-invariant conditional-complement space,
(15.22)--(15.23) prove the sharper inverse constant \(96/(287\kappa)\).
The projection and unitary supplying that restriction are explicit.

# 13. Absolute decay of the unbounded electric covariance

Throughout Sections 13--14, \(0<\xi\le1/49152\). Retain \(H,\psi\)
and \(E_e\) exactly as in Section 1, and set
\[
\Delta_*=\frac{287\kappa}{384},\qquad
Q_\psi=I-|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|,\qquad
\alpha_t(O)=e^{itH}Oe^{-itH}.
\]
Equation (12.8), not an additional assumption, gives
\(A|_{\psi^\perp}\ge\Delta_*\), where \(A=H-\mathcal E\).
Let \(d(e,f)\) be distance in the shared-face graph of Section 11.
We will prove
\[
|C_{ef}|\le1200\xi e^{-d(e,f)/4}\qquad(e\ne f).               \tag{13.1}
\]
This is a bound on the original electric operators, which are unbounded.
No finite-spin Hamiltonian or approximate ground state is introduced.

The two primary methods are B. Nachtergaele and R. Sims,
*On the dynamics of lattice systems with unbounded on-site terms in the
Hamiltonian*, arXiv:1410.8174v1, Sections 2--3, especially Proposition 2.1,
Lemma 2.2 and the proof of Theorem 3.1
([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8174v1)), and the same authors,
*Lieb-Robinson Bounds and the Exponential Clustering Theorem*,
Commun. Math. Phys. 265 (2006), 119--130,

([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0506030v3)).
The former explicitly repairs domain and strong-continuity issues in
earlier unbounded-on-site proofs. Both source TeX files are retained.
We prove the numerical bounds and the electric-operator passage below;
neither is obtained by assigning constants to an existential statement.

## 13.1. A second electric moment and an exact cutoff comparison

For \(S=\{e\}\), joint spectral calculus in (2.7) gives, for
\(f\in\operatorname{Dom}(E_e)\),
\[
\|E_e^2R_{\{e\}}f\|\le\kappa^{-1}\|E_ef\|.
\]
Indeed, on a nonconstant link sector the multiplier satisfies
\(\lambda_e^2/(\kappa\lambda_e+k)\le\lambda_e/\kappa\);
it vanishes on the constant link sector. Applying this to the smooth
vector \(W_e^\star\psi\) in (2.8), and noting \(E_e^2P_{\{e\}}\psi=0\),
proves
\[
\|E_e^2\psi\|\le\xi\|E_e(W_e^\star\psi)\|
\le\frac{3r_e}{2}\xi+8r_e^2\xi^2
\le6\xi+128\xi^2\le7\xi.                                   \tag{13.2}
\]
Here the full product rule is
\[
E_e(W_e^\star\psi)=\tfrac34W_e^\star\psi+
 W_e^\star E_e\psi-2D_e\psi.
\]
The three terms have bounds \(3r_e/2\), \(4r_e^2\xi\), and
\(4r_e^2\xi\), respectively: the last follows from
\(\|D_e\psi\|\le r_e\sqrt{\gamma_e}\le2r_e^2\xi\), using (10.5).
Thus the mixed derivative has been estimated, not omitted.

For any \(\Lambda>0\), define the bounded one-link observable
\[
B_e^\Lambda=E_e\mathbf1_{[0,\Lambda]}(E_e),\qquad
\|B_e^\Lambda\|\le\Lambda.
\]
It is a functional calculus of the original \(E_e\); it changes neither
\(H\) nor \(\psi\). For its spectral tail,
\(\lambda\mathbf1_{\lambda>\Lambda}\le\lambda^2/\Lambda\), hence
\[
\|(E_e-B_e^\Lambda)\psi\|\le7\xi/\Lambda,\qquad
\|Q_\psi B_e^\Lambda\psi\|\le\|B_e^\Lambda\psi\|
 \le\|E_e\psi\|\le8\xi.                                     \tag{13.3}
\]
Define
\(\operatorname{Cov}_\psi(O,P)=
\langle Q_\psi O\psi,Q_\psi P\psi\rangle\) for self-adjoint
observables with \(\psi\) in their domains.
Subtracting the two centered inner products, retaining both difference
terms, gives
\[
|C_{ef}-\operatorname{Cov}_\psi(B_e^\Lambda,B_f^\Lambda)|
\le112\xi^2/\Lambda.                                        \tag{13.4}
\]
Both original link Casimirs and their spectral projections commute with
endpoint gauge transformations; every cutoff observable is physical.

## 13.2. Locality for the complete dynamics

For bounded observables \(O_e,O_f\) on distinct links, we claim
\[
\|[\alpha_t(O_e),O_f]\|
\le2\|O_e\|\|O_f\|e^{-d(e,f)}
       (e^{v|t|}-1),\qquad v=192b.                           \tag{13.5}
\]
This intermediate statement holds at every positive coupling.
Here are the domain construction and the full counting proof.

For a finite link set \(X\), introduce the auxiliary self-adjoint operator
\[
H_X^0=H_0+2bM+\sum_{\partial p\subset X}V_p,\qquad V_p=-bW_p.
\]
It has the same \(H^2\) domain as \(H\), and its dynamics preserves
the algebra of bounded operators supported on \(X\). Its difference
from \(H\) is bounded. The propagator
\[
W_X(t,s)=e^{itH_X^0}e^{-i(t-s)H}e^{-isH_X^0}
\]
has inverse \(W_X(s,t)\), and on the common domain differentiating gives
\[
\partial_tW_X(t,s)=-iK_X(t)W_X(t,s),\qquad
K_X(t)=e^{itH_X^0}(H-H_X^0)e^{-itH_X^0}.
\]
This bounded self-adjoint generator is strongly continuous. Its vectorwise
Dyson integrals exist, and on each compact time interval their norms are
bounded by the exponential series with parameter
\(\sup_t\|K_X(t)\|\). Iteration of the integral equation gives the series;
iteration for the difference of two solutions gives zero, since its
\(n\)-th bound has a factorial denominator. Consequently the domain
derivative agrees with that strong solution on the whole Hilbert space.
This justifies the differentiation below for bounded observables without
assuming operator-norm continuity of the unbounded on-site evolution.

Let \(\beta_{X,t}(O)=W_X(0,t)OW_X(t,0)\), and let
\(\partial_{\mathsf P}X\) be the faces meeting both \(X\) and \(X^c\).
For \(O\) supported on \(X\), the strong commutator derivative and Jacobi
identity give
\[
\begin{split}
F(t)&=[\beta_{X,t}(O),O_f],\\
F'(t)&=i[L_X(t),F(t)]
   +i[\beta_{X,t}(O),[O_f,L_X(t)]],\\
L_X(t)&=\sum_{p\in\partial_{\mathsf P}X}\alpha_t(V_p).
\end{split}
\]
Terms outside \(X\) commute with \(O\), and terms inside \(X\) are already
in \(H_X^0\); the crossing faces are therefore exactly the stated ones.
Conjugate this equation by the unitary strong propagator generated by
\(-L_X(t)\). Integrating its remaining inhomogeneous term and taking
norms proves
\[
\|F(t)\|\le\|[O,O_f]\|+
 2\|O\|\sum_{p\in\partial_{\mathsf P}X}
 \int_0^{|t|}\|[\alpha_{\operatorname{sgn}(t)s}(V_p),O_f]\|\,ds.
\]
At any fixed final \(t\), insert
\(O=e^{itH_X^0}O_Xe^{-itH_X^0}\), which still has support \(X\)
and norm \(\|O_X\|\). This is a pointwise use of the already proved
inequality, not differentiation of a time-dependent initial observable.
It yields the recurrence
\[
\begin{split}
\|[\alpha_t(O_X),O_f]\|
&\le2\|O_X\|\|O_f\|\mathbf1_{f\in X}\\
&\quad+2\|O_X\|\sum_{p\in\partial_{\mathsf P}X}
 \int_0^{|t|}\|[\alpha_{\operatorname{sgn}(t)s}(V_p),O_f]\|\,ds .
\end{split}                                                   \tag{13.6}
\]
The Hilbert spaces here are separable. Every strongly continuous
commutator has a measurable norm, as the supremum over a countable
dense set of unit vectors; these scalar integrals are well-defined.

Iterate (13.6) from \(X=\{e\}\). A term reaching \(f\) in \(n\)
interactions is a chain of \(n\) faces, the first containing \(e\),
consecutive faces intersecting, and the last containing \(f\).
Such a chain gives a shared-face link path of at most \(n\) steps;
therefore \(n\ge d(e,f)\). There are at most \(4\) choices of the
first face and \(16\) choices of every subsequent face, since a face
contains four links and each link meets at most four faces. Each
interaction has norm at most \(2b\). The remainder after \(n\) iterations
is bounded by a constant times \((64b|t|)^n/n!\) and tends to zero.
Dropping only counted positive terms gives
\[
\|[\alpha_t(O_e),O_f]\|
\le2\|O_e\|\|O_f\|\sum_{n\ge d(e,f)}
 \frac{(64b|t|)^n}{n!}
\le2\|O_e\|\|O_f\|e^{-d(e,f)}
       (e^{64\exp(1)b|t|}-1).
\]
The last inequality uses \(\exp(n-d)\ge1\) for \(n\ge d\).
The series for \(\exp(1)\), with \(n!\ge2^{n-1}\) for \(n\ge2\)
and a strict inequality for \(n\ge3\), gives \(\exp(1)<3\).
This proves (13.5), including its explicit \(192b\).
The constant \(2bM\) has commuted through every displayed conjugation;
the original Hamiltonian and its energy origin remain unchanged.

## 13.3. Spectral filtering with the actual vacuum moments

Take bounded self-adjoint \(O_e,O_f\), set
\(q_e=Q_\psi O_e\psi,\ q_f=Q_\psi O_f\psi\), and put
\(s_0=\|q_e\|\|q_f\|\). For
\[
h(t)=\langle\psi,[O_e,\alpha_t(O_f)]\psi\rangle
=\langle q_e,e^{itA}q_f\rangle-\langle q_f,e^{-itA}q_e\rangle
\]
one has \(|h(t)|\le2s_0\). For \(\alpha>0\), introduce the scalar integral
\[
I_\alpha=\lim_{\epsilon\downarrow0}\frac1{2\pi}
 \int_{\mathbb R}\frac{e^{-\alpha t^2}h(t)}{\epsilon+it}\,dt.
\]
The limit is absolutely dominated: (13.5) makes \(h(t)=O(|t|)\)
at zero, while the Gaussian controls infinity. For \(\epsilon>0\),
use
\((\epsilon+it)^{-1}=\int_0^\infty e^{-\epsilon u-itu}\,du\)
and integrate the Gaussian in \(t\). Fubini is justified by its
integrable absolute majorant. Letting \(\epsilon\downarrow0\) gives
the bounded spectral multiplier
\[
F_\alpha(\lambda)=\frac1{\sqrt{4\pi\alpha}}
 \int_0^\infty e^{-(u-\lambda)^2/(4\alpha)}\,du
\]
and the exact identity
\[
I_\alpha=\langle q_e,F_\alpha(A)q_f\rangle
          -\langle q_f,F_\alpha(-A)q_e\rangle.
\]
The Gaussian transform itself follows by differentiating its integral
with respect to its Fourier variable, integrating by parts, and fixing
the constant at zero by the squared Gaussian integral.
For \(\lambda\ge\Delta_*\), substitution followed by
\((x+y)^2\ge x^2+y^2\) gives
\[
0\le1-F_\alpha(\lambda)=F_\alpha(-\lambda)
\le\tfrac12e^{-\Delta_*^2/(4\alpha)}.
\]
The total variation of a cross spectral measure is at most
\(\|q_e\|\|q_f\|\): on a disjoint measurable partition apply
Cauchy--Schwarz to the two sequences of spectral-projection norms.
Thus every spectral interchange above is controlled, and
\[
|\operatorname{Cov}_\psi(O_e,O_f)-I_\alpha|
\le s_0e^{-\Delta_*^2/(4\alpha)}.
\]
Splitting its time integral at \(T>0\), (13.5) controls the part
\(|t|\le T\), while \(2s_0\) controls the rest. The explicit estimates
\[
\frac{e^{vt}-1}{t}\le ve^{vt},\qquad
\int_T^\infty\frac{e^{-\alpha t^2}}t\,dt
\le\frac{e^{-\alpha T^2}}{2\alpha T^2}
\]
follow respectively by integrating the exponential derivative and by
using \(1/t\le t/T^2\). Choosing \(\alpha=\Delta_*/(2T)\) proves
\[
\begin{split}
|\operatorname{Cov}_\psi(O_e,O_f)|
&\le\frac{2\|O_e\|\|O_f\|}{\pi}
        vT e^{-d(e,f)+vT}\\
&\quad+s_0\left(1+\frac2{\pi\Delta_*T}\right)
        e^{-\Delta_*T/2}.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{13.7}
\]
The Gaussian is only an integral filter in this proof. The dynamics,
vacuum and interaction have never been replaced by Gaussian ones.

For \(d=d(e,f)\ge1\), now use
\[
O_e=B_e^\Lambda,\quad O_f=B_f^\Lambda,\quad
\Lambda=e^{d/4},\qquad T=\frac{d}{\Delta_*+2v}.
\]
The original parameters give exactly
\[
\frac v{\Delta_*}=\frac{73728}{287}\xi\le\frac3{574},\qquad
vT\le\frac{3d}{580}<\frac d{100},\qquad
\Delta_*T\ge\frac{287d}{290}.                                \tag{13.8}
\]
Consequently the first term in (13.7) is at most
\[
\frac{73728}{287}\xi d\,e^{-49d/100}
\le1100\xi e^{-d/4}.
\]
We used \(2/\pi<1\), and
\(d e^{-6d/25}\le25/6\), which follows from \(e^x\ge x\);
the exact remaining coefficient is \(307200/287<1100\).
By (13.3), \(s_0\le64\xi^2\). The second term in (13.7) is at most
\(192\xi^2e^{-d/4}\): its parenthesis is less than \(3\) for
\(d\ge1\) and \(\Delta_*T/2\ge287d/580>d/4\).
Finally (13.4) contributes at most \(112\xi^2e^{-d/4}\).
Their sum is bounded by
\((1100\xi+304\xi^2)e^{-d/4}\le1200\xi e^{-d/4}\).
This proves (13.1) for the original unbounded covariance.

# 14. A volume-uniform two-sided remainder and the original native quotient

Define the real symmetric remainder
\[
\mathscr R=C-\frac{\xi^2}{16}\mathsf I^{\mathsf T}\mathsf I.
\]
For every entry (5.3) gives \(|\mathscr R_{ef}|\le42500\xi^3\).
For \(d(e,f)\ge2\) there is no shared face, so
\(\mathscr R_{ef}=C_{ef}\) exactly and (13.1) applies.
These are two estimates of the same exact entries; no correlation
is set to zero.

The injective indexing map \(x(n,i)=2n+\mathbf e_i\) and its inverse
were proved in Section 9. Any two links on one face have indexing
\(\ell^1\) distance at most 2, as inspection of its four midpoints
shows. A graph ball of integer radius \(D\) therefore lies inside
the integer cube of coordinate side \(4D+1\), and contains at most
\((4D+1)^3\) links, including near the original box boundary.
For a shell of radius \(n\) we use the valid upper bound
\((4n+1)^3\), not a difference of two bounding cube volumes.
For every integer \(D\ge1\), this proves
\[
\sup_e\sum_f|\mathscr R_{ef}|
\le42500\xi^3(4D+1)^3+
1200\xi\sum_{n>D}(4n+1)^3e^{-n/4}.                           \tag{14.1}
\]

Here is a closed, explicit bound with no remaining infinite sum.
For \(0<q<1\) put
\[
G(A,q)=\frac{A^3}{1-q}
 +\frac{12A^2q}{(1-q)^2}
 +\frac{48Aq(1+q)}{(1-q)^3}
 +\frac{64q(1+4q+q^2)}{(1-q)^4}.
\]
The geometric series and its first three applications of \(q\,d/dq\)
give respectively
\[
\sum_{j\ge0}q^j=\frac1{1-q},\quad
\sum_{j\ge0}jq^j=\frac q{(1-q)^2},\quad
\sum_{j\ge0}j^2q^j=\frac{q(1+q)}{(1-q)^3},\quad
\sum_{j\ge0}j^3q^j=\frac{q(1+4q+q^2)}{(1-q)^4}.
\]
Termwise differentiation is justified by uniform convergence on each
compact subinterval of \((0,1)\). Expanding \((A+4j)^3\) and using
these four identities proves
\[
\sum_{n>D}(4n+1)^3q^n=q^{D+1}G(4D+5,q).                      \tag{14.2}
\]
Write \(z=\log(1/\xi)>0\), set \(D=\lceil8z\rceil\), and use
\(q=e^{-1/4}<4/5\), the latter following from \(e^{1/4}>1+1/4\).
Then \(q^D\le\xi^2\), \(4D+1\le32z+5\), and
\(4D+5\le32z+9\). All coefficients of \(G\) are positive.
Define the explicit cubic polynomial
\[
\mathcal P(z)=42500(32z+5)^3+1200G(32z+9,4/5),
\qquad \epsilon_\xi=\xi\mathcal P(\log(1/\xi)).              \tag{14.3}
\]
Equations (14.1)--(14.2) now prove
\[
\sup_e\sum_f|\mathscr R_{ef}|
\le\xi^3\mathcal P(\log(1/\xi))=\xi^2\epsilon_\xi.             \tag{14.4}
\]
The same bound holds for column sums by symmetry. For completeness,
Cauchy--Schwarz in the nonnegative weights \(|\mathscr R_{ef}|\)
gives
\[
\sum_e|(\mathscr Rw)_e|^2
\le\left(\sup_e\sum_f|\mathscr R_{ef}|\right)
 \sum_f|w_f|^2\sum_e|\mathscr R_{ef}|.
\]
Thus (14.4) bounds its operator norm on \(\ell^2(\mathsf E_L)\)
and yields the two-sided inequality
\[
\left|w^{\mathsf T}Cw-
          \frac{\xi^2}{16}\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\right|
\le\xi^2\epsilon_\xi\|w\|_2^2
\quad\text{for every real }w.                               \tag{14.5}
\]
In particular the absolute rows of \(C\) are uniformly summable:
\(\sum_ft_{ef}=4r_e\le16\), so
\(\sup_e\sum_f|C_{ef}|\le\xi^2(1+\epsilon_\xi)\).
The remainder has order
\(\xi^3(1+\log(1/\xi))^3\), uniformly in the full box.
No order-\(\xi^4\) assertion is substituted for that proved order.

There is an entirely explicit interval on which the relative estimate
is nonvacuous:
\[
0<\xi\le10^{-16}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\epsilon_\xi<1/32.
                                                               \tag{14.6}
\]
To verify every constant, \(\mathcal P\) has positive coefficients
and degree three. For \(z\ge3\), every \(e^{-z}z^k\),
\(0\le k\le3\), is nonincreasing, by differentiation.
Hence \(e^{-z}\mathcal P(z)\) is nonincreasing there.
The elementary bounds \(e<3<10<e^3\), proved by the exponential
series, give \(16<16\log10<48\). At \(z_0=16\log10\),
\[
e^{-z_0}\mathcal P(z_0)
\le10^{-16}\mathcal P(48)
=\frac{356710369517}{20000000000000}<\frac1{32}.
\]
The exact integer evaluation is
\(\mathcal P(48)=178355184758500\).
Monotonicity proves (14.6), and the same exponential-series bounds
show \(\epsilon_\xi\to0\) as \(\xi\downarrow0\).
The smaller interval is used for the explicit positive lower
denominators below; (14.5) holds on all of (11.16).

For every nonzero nonnegative weight vector, summing the facewise
inequalities \((\sum w_e)^2\ge\sum w_e^2\) gives
\(\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\ge2\|w\|_2^2\).
Equations (14.5)--(14.6) imply
\[
\|v_w\|^2=w^{\mathsf T}Cw\ge\frac{3\xi^2}{32}\|w\|_2^2>0,
\qquad
\left|\frac{\mathfrak q_A[v_w]}{\|v_w\|^2}-3\kappa\right|
\le\kappa(3744000\xi+32\epsilon_\xi).                        \tag{14.7}
\]
For the second inequality subtract \(3\kappa\) times (14.5) from
(7.2): the numerator error is at most
\(\kappa\xi^2(351000\xi+3\epsilon_\xi)\|w\|_2^2\).
Divide by the positive lower bound just proved.
The conclusion is uniform over all boxes and all such weights, not
merely over a prescribed finite support.

For the unchanged native weights of (1.4), (14.5) reads
\[
\left|\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2-\frac{\xi^2}{4}\mathcal A_L\right|
\le\xi^2\epsilon_\xi S_{2,L}
\le2\xi^2\epsilon_\xi\mathcal A_L.                            \tag{14.8}
\]
Thus its relative denominator error is at most \(8\epsilon_\xi\),
with no \(L^3\) loss. On (14.6),
\[
\frac{3\xi^2}{16}\mathcal A_L
\le\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2
\le\frac{5\xi^2}{16}\mathcal A_L,                             \tag{14.9}
\]
and the exact physical native electric-state quotient satisfies (14.7).
No original \(n_2^2\) weight or original scale has been changed.
The physical substitution remains
\(\xi=1/(4g_{\rm YM}^4)\), \(\kappa=2g_{\rm YM}^2/a\);
the explicit interval (14.6) is \(g_{\rm YM}^4\ge2500000000000000\).
This conservative numerical interval is not claimed optimal.

For signed weights (14.5) is still valid, but the nonnegative-weight
lower bound is not asserted. On the full leading kernel it gives
\[
0\le\|v_w\|^2\le\xi^2\epsilon_\xi\|w\|_2^2
\qquad(\mathsf Iw=0).                                       \tag{14.10}
\]
The fourth-order forms already proved in the parent remain intact.
Equations (7.3) and (12.14) remain additional upper bounds, and the
smallest of these proved bounds may be used. A uniform fourth-order
kernel remainder and the minimum over all signed electric weights
have not been obtained by this argument.
Section 15 below obtains a uniform bound on that minimum by proving the
gauge-equivariance of the full cluster similarity and using the exact
physical free threshold. It does not identify the fourth-order kernel
quotient by dividing (14.10).
Section 16 instead constructs the exact two-face correction function,
bounds its full-vacuum residual, and proves that kernel quotient with
an explicit uniform remainder in (16.24).
Nor does (14.7) remove the fixed-regulator restriction on the
small-angle remainder in (1.4), construct a spatial continuum theory,
or determine the Millennium mass gap.

# 15. The gauge-restricted threshold and the full signed electric minimum

The physical constraint improves the full-space estimate (12.8) by a
factor of four, without changing the interaction or the interval (11.16).
We prove the gauge maps, the free threshold, and the restricted resolvent
before using the improvement for the actual interacting states.

The literature source for the finite-graph gauge Hilbert space and its

The source constructs the invariant Hilbert space from edge
representations and vertex intertwiners. The leaf argument below proves
the particular free spectral bound directly, including the original
open boundary and every endpoint gauge transformation.

## 15.1. Exact gauge projection, source convention, and support sectors

Retain the entire vertex set and define
\[
\mathcal G_L=SU(2)^{\mathsf V_L},\qquad
(\alpha_gU)_e=g_{s(e)}U_eg_{t(e)}^{-1},\qquad
(\mathsf T_g f)(U)=f(\alpha_{g^{-1}}U).                       \tag{15.1}
\]
There is no restriction of \(g_v\) to the identity at boundary vertices
and no external charged representation at a vertex. These are precisely
the gauge transformations of Section 1. Group multiplication gives
\(\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}\), hence
\(\mathsf T_g\mathsf T_h=\mathsf T_{gh}\).
Left and right Haar invariance on each link prove
\(\|\mathsf T_g f\|=\|f\|\) and
\(\mathsf T_g^*=\mathsf T_{g^{-1}}\).
Translations of continuous functions are continuous in \(g\), and
density extends this to strong continuity on \(\mathcal H_L\).
Thus the strong Haar integral
\[
\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}=\int_{\mathcal G_L}\mathsf T_g\,dg,
\qquad
\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}
 =\{f:\mathsf T_gf=f\text{ for every }g\}
 =\operatorname{Ran}\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}                    \tag{15.2}
\]
exists and is bounded. Haar invariance gives
\(\mathsf T_h\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}=\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}\);
inversion invariance gives
\(\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}^*=\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}\).
Integrating the first identity proves
\(\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}^2=\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}\).
Conversely the integral fixes every invariant vector, proving both
range identities in (15.2).

Baez uses the coordinate action
\(A_e\mapsto g_{t(e)}A_eg_{s(e)}^{-1}\).
The exact dictionary, on the same directed graph, is
\[
\jmath:SU(2)^{\mathsf E_L}\longrightarrow SU(2)^{\mathsf E_L},
\qquad
A_e=\jmath(U)_e=U_e^{-1},\qquad \jmath^{-1}=\jmath.             \tag{15.3}
\]
Indeed \((g_sU_eg_t^{-1})^{-1}=g_tU_e^{-1}g_s^{-1}\).
The pullback \(\mathsf Jf=f\circ\jmath\), from the source's Haar
Hilbert space to ours, is therefore a unitary intertwiner with
inverse the same pullback. Haar measure is invariant under inversion.
Inversion is an isometry for the bi-invariant metric with the
\(T_a\) frame of (1.2), so it preserves the Sobolev domains and
intertwines every \(E_e\). This proves the gauge-space dictionary;
it does not silently reverse a Wilson traversal in (1.1).

Each \(\mathsf T_g\) is a product of link isometries, so it preserves
\(H^1,H^2\) and commutes with \(E_e\) on its operator domain.
In (1.1) the endpoint factors cancel at the four consecutive vertices,
leaving conjugation by \(g_n\) inside the trace. Thus every \(W_p\),
and consequently \(H,H_0,V_p\), is gauge invariant on its stated
domain. The gauge projection also preserves these domains, by
integrating in the corresponding graph norm.

Let \(P_e\) be Haar averaging in the one link \(e\), followed by the
constant lift. Endpoint Haar invariance gives
\(P_e\mathsf T_g=\mathsf T_gP_e\). In Section 11 notation,
the embedded sector projection is exactly
\[
\mathsf Q_I=
 \prod_{e\in I}(I-P_e)\prod_{f\notin I}P_f,
\qquad
\mathsf Q_If=(\Pi_If)\otimes1_{I^c}.                         \tag{15.4}
\]
Products commute, so \(\mathsf Q_I\) commutes with the gauge
representation and with \(\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}\).
The finite sum of all \(\mathsf Q_I\) is the identity, by expanding
\(\prod_e[(I-P_e)+P_e]\).
Restricting the unitary (11.2) consequently gives the exact
orthogonal decomposition
\[
\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}
 =\bigoplus_{I\subset\mathsf E_L}
     \bigl(\mathcal H'_I\otimes1_{I^c}\bigr)^{\mathcal G_L}.
                                                               \tag{15.5}
\]
The inverse map remains the collection of Haar projections (15.4).
The action on the \(I\) factor is the restriction of the product
link representation, not a gauge group with its boundary removed.

## 15.2. Leaf annihilation and the exact free physical threshold

For a nonempty set \(I\) of links, consider the undirected graph
with these edges and their endpoints. Suppose a vertex \(v\)
has exactly one incident edge \(e\) in \(I\). For
\[
f\in\bigl(\mathcal H'_I\otimes1_{I^c}\bigr)^{\mathcal G_L},
\]
vary only \(g_v\). On the \(I\) factors this translates only the
variable \(U_e\), on the left or the right according to its
original orientation. On the exterior factors it acts on constants.
Since \(f\) is invariant, integration over this single \(SU(2)\)
gauge variable gives
\[
f=\int_{SU(2)}\mathsf T_{g_v}f\,dg_v=P_ef=0.                 \tag{15.6}
\]
The second equality is exactly left or right Haar averaging; the
last equality follows from the \(I-P_e\) factor in (15.4).
For arbitrary, possibly entangled \(L^2\) vectors the identity
follows first on elementary tensors, then by density and the
boundedness of the two averages. Thus no pointwise representative
or unstated smoothness is used in the leaf argument.

It follows that every nonempty support of a nonzero invariant sector
has degree at least two at every one of its incident vertices.
Such a finite graph contains a cycle: choose a simple path of
maximal length; at its last vertex there is a neighbor other than
the preceding vertex. Maximality places that neighbor earlier in
the path, and the resulting segment closes a simple cycle.
The original cubic graph has no loops or multiple edges.
The coloring \(n\mapsto(-1)^{n_1+n_2+n_3}\) changes sign along
every edge, so every cycle has even length. Its length is therefore
at least four. In particular,
\[
\bigl(\mathcal H'_I\otimes1_{I^c}\bigr)^{\mathcal G_L}
 \ne\{0\},\quad I\ne\varnothing
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad |I|\ge4.                          \tag{15.7}
\]
This proof includes vertices on faces, edges, and corners of the
open box. Omitting a boundary gauge transformation would invalidate
the corresponding step (15.6); no such omission has been made.

On a nonempty support (11.3) gives
\(H_I\ge(3\kappa/4)|I|\), on its full domain and hence on its
invariant subspace. Combining (15.5)--(15.7) and summing the
orthogonal nonempty sectors yields the form inequality
\[
H_0\big|_{\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}\cap\Omega^\perp}
 \ge 3\kappa I.                                             \tag{15.8}
\]
The constant is attained. For any elementary face \(p\), its
unchanged \(W_p\) is gauge invariant and is a fundamental
matrix coefficient in each of its four distinct link variables,
including the two inverse traversals. Bi-invariance of the
Casimir gives
\[
E_eW_p=\tfrac34W_p\quad(e\in\partial p),\qquad
E_eW_p=0\quad(e\notin\partial p).
\]
Integration in one participating link, with all others held fixed,
gives \(\int W_p\,dU=0\) and \(\int |W_p|^2dU=1\).
For the latter, the product inside the trace is Haar distributed
under that integral, also for an inverse occurrence, and the
fundamental matrix-coefficient identity
\(\int U_{ij}\overline{U_{k\ell}}\,dU
 =\delta_{ik}\delta_{j\ell}/2\) gives the unit norm of its trace.
Consequently
\[
H_0W_p=3\kappa W_p,\qquad
W_p\in\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}\cap\Omega^\perp,\qquad
\|W_p\|=1.                                                   \tag{15.9}
\]
This proves the exact free physical threshold \(3\kappa\), rather
than merely a lower estimate. No free vector is substituted for
the interacting vacuum in the argument that follows.

## 15.3. Gauge-equivariance of the interacting cluster similarity

The fixed-point construction of Section 11 may be performed within
the invariant sector collections. To prove that statement, assume
each \(z_I\otimes1_{I^c}\) is gauge invariant. The gauge operator
factorizes as \(\mathsf T_{g,I}\otimes\mathsf T_{g,I^c}\).
Both \(z_I\) and \(1_I\) are fixed by the first factor. Hence
the rank-one creation operator (11.4) satisfies
\[
\mathsf T_g\widehat z_I\mathsf T_g^{-1}
 =|\mathsf T_{g,I}z_I\rangle
   \langle\mathsf T_{g,I}1_I|\otimes I_{I^c}
 =\widehat z_I.                                             \tag{15.10}
\]
The projections \(\Pi_I\) intertwine the full representation with
its sector action by (15.4). The operator \(H_I^{-1}\) commutes
with this action by the reducing property and functional calculus.
Since \(V_p\) and \(\Omega\) are invariant, (11.10) therefore sends
invariant collections to invariant collections.

Iteration starts at zero. Every iterate is invariant, and the
limit in the energy norm (11.7) is invariant because fixed
subspaces of bounded representations are closed. Thus the actual
fixed point has the claimed invariance. Its creation sum \(C(z)\)
and the two finite polynomial exponentials commute with
\(\mathsf T_g\) and \(\mathsf P_{\mathcal G}\).
The domain preservation proved in (11.9) also holds upon restriction.
In particular the exact relation remains
\[
\psi=\alpha e^{C(z)}\Omega,\qquad
\alpha=\langle\Omega,\psi\rangle>0,
\]
with the scalar and unit physical vacuum specified in (12.7).

Write \(\widetilde H=H_0+\mathcal K\) as in (12.1).
All three operators preserve the physical subspace; the bounded
invertible similarity and its inverse do as well. The restriction
of the sector norm (12.2) is still equivalent to the Hilbert norm,
with its same explicitly volume-dependent upper comparison.
The relative estimate is unchanged:
\[
\|\mathcal K f\|_{\oplus,1}
 \le c_\xi\|H_0 f\|_{\oplus,1},\qquad
c_\xi=\frac{512}{3}\xi\le\frac1{288},
\quad
f\in\operatorname{Dom}(H_0)\cap\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}.
                                                               \tag{15.11}
\]
We do not replace the per-link bound used to prove this estimate
by a larger value or alter its numerical contraction.

On every nonempty invariant sector, the spectral parameter
\(\lambda\) of \(H_I\) satisfies \(\lambda\ge3\kappa\)
by (15.7). Therefore, for \(0<t<3\kappa(1-c_\xi)\),
\[
\|\mathcal K(H_0-t)^{-1}\|_{\oplus,1;\mathrm{phys}}
 \le c_\xi\sup_{\lambda\ge3\kappa}
               \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-t}
 =\frac{3\kappa c_\xi}{3\kappa-t}<1.                         \tag{15.12}
\]
The constant sector contributes zero because
\(\mathcal K\Omega=0\), exactly as in Section 12.
The Neumann series therefore gives a bounded inverse for
\(\widetilde H-t\) on the physical subspace. Its image is in the
restricted \(H_0\) domain: factor the inverse as
\((H_0-t)^{-1}[I+\mathcal K(H_0-t)^{-1}]^{-1}\).
Norm equivalence and the invariant similarities transfer that
inverse to \(H-\mathcal E-t\) on the original physical Hilbert
space. No form positivity is claimed for the nonunitary similarity
itself. Applying the spectral theorem to the original self-adjoint
restriction, with its simple ground eigenvalue, proves
\[
(H-\mathcal E)\big|_{\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}\cap\psi^\perp}
 \ge 3\kappa\left(1-\frac{512}{3}\xi\right)I
 \ge\frac{287\kappa}{96}I,
\qquad 0<\xi\le\frac1{49152}.                                \tag{15.13}
\]
In original parameters the last constant is
\(287g_{\rm YM}^2/(48a)\) and the range is
\(g_{\rm YM}^4\ge12288\).
The full, not necessarily invariant Hilbert-space bound remains
(12.8), with constant \(287\kappa/384\). The fourfold improvement
is asserted exactly on the physical restriction just proved.

## 15.4. Covariance order, signed states, and an attained uniform minimum

Every \(E_e\) commutes with the gauge representation, so each
centered vector \(v_e\) is in
\(\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}\cap\psi^\perp\).
There is no sign restriction on the coefficients in a real linear
combination. Applying (15.13) to every \(v_w\), including a zero
vector, gives the matrix inequality
\[
\mathcal N\ \ge\
3\kappa(1-c_\xi)C\ \ge\ 0
\quad\hbox{on }\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}.                       \tag{15.14}
\]
Combining it with the upper side of (7.2) yields
\[
0\le w^{\mathsf T}Cw
 \le\frac{\xi^2\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2/16
               +117000\xi^3\|w\|_2^2}{1-512\xi/3}.           \tag{15.15}
\]
Here \(351000/3=117000\); the leading coefficient is \(1/16\).
The exact facewise estimate \(\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2\le16\|w\|_2^2\)
from Section 12 gives
\[
0\le C\le
\frac{\xi^2+117000\xi^3}{1-512\xi/3}
 I_{\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}}.                                \tag{15.16}
\]
On \(\ker\mathsf I\) the numerator of (15.15) is exactly
\(117000\xi^3\|w\|_2^2\). This is an upper bound, not a
fourth-order identification or a discarded null direction.
For the unchanged native weights,
\[
\|v_{w^{\rm nat}}\|^2
 \le\frac{\xi^2\mathcal A_L/4+117000\xi^3 S_{2,L}}
              {1-512\xi/3}
 \le\frac{\xi^2\mathcal A_L}{4}
       \frac{1+936000\xi}{1-512\xi/3}.                       \tag{15.17}
\]
The last step uses \(S_{2,L}\le2\mathcal A_L\), without changing
the coefficients or coordinates in the original state.

To define the signed minimum without dividing by an unproved
denominator, let \(\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys},\mathbb R}\) denote
the real-valued invariant functions and define
\[
\mathsf V_\xi:\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}
 \longrightarrow\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys},\mathbb R}\cap\psi^\perp,
\qquad
\mathsf V_\xi w=v_w,\qquad
\mathscr W_\xi=\operatorname{Ran}\mathsf V_\xi.               \tag{15.18}
\]
Its Gram identity is
\(\langle\mathsf V_\xi w,\mathsf V_\xi z\rangle=w^{\mathsf T}Cz\).
Thus
\(\ker\mathsf V_\xi=\ker C\): \(Cw=0\) implies zero norm of
\(\mathsf V_\xi w\); conversely a zero vector has zero inner
product with every \(\mathsf V_\xi z\).
The induced map
\[
\overline{\mathsf V}_\xi:
\bigl(\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}/\ker C,\,
       \langle[w],[z]\rangle_C=w^{\mathsf T}Cz\bigr)
 \longrightarrow\mathscr W_\xi                              \tag{15.19}
\]
is an isometric linear bijection. The bilinear form is well-defined
because \(C\) annihilates its kernel, and it is positive on every
nonzero equivalence class by the Gram identity.
The inverse sends a vector \(v_w\) to its class \([w]\);
two preimages differ by \(\ker C\), which proves independence of
choice. The same identity for the energy form shows that
\(\mathcal N\) annihilates \(\ker C\) and descends to the quotient.
This records the exact information loss. No equality
\(\ker C=\ker\mathsf I\), or \(\ker C=\{0\}\), is assumed.

On \(0<\xi\le1/680000\), (7.5)--(7.6) give a nonzero
\(v_e\) for every link, so \(\mathscr W_\xi\ne\{0\}\).
It is finite dimensional and consists of smooth vectors.
The energy form is a continuous quadratic form on this finite
dimensional space. Its restriction to the unit sphere attains a
minimum by compactness. Through (15.19) this number is exactly
\[
\mathfrak m_L(\xi)
 =\min_{\substack{w\in\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}\\
                  w^{\mathsf T}Cw>0}}
       \frac{w^{\mathsf T}\mathcal N w}{w^{\mathsf T}Cw}.
                                                               \tag{15.20}
\]
Write \(\Delta_{\mathrm{phys},L}(\xi)\) for the first positive
spectral value of \(H-\mathcal E\) on
\(\mathcal H_{\mathrm{phys}}\).
Its existence follows from compact resolvent, the simple ground
eigenvalue, and the nonzero physical excited subspace; this is the
same excitation operator as in (15.13).
The spectral variational principle, (15.14), and the actual
single-link trial bound (7.6) prove the complete chain
\[
\begin{split}
3\kappa-512\kappa\xi
 &=3\kappa(1-c_\xi)\\
 &\le\Delta_{\mathrm{phys},L}(\xi)
 \le\mathfrak m_L(\xi)
 \le3\kappa+2472000\kappa\xi ,
\qquad 0<\xi\le\frac1{680000}.
\end{split}                                                \tag{15.21}
\]
Every \(L\ge2\) is covered by these same constants and coupling
interval. In particular the estimate permits weights that depend
on \(L,\xi\), have arbitrary signs, or lie in \(\ker\mathsf I\),
whenever they represent a nonzero actual state. Such a state is
included in the minimization, not excluded by a leading-coefficient
test. The quotient construction retains all zero actual states as
the explicitly identified kernel, where an energy quotient has no
defined value.

Equation (15.21) proves both uniform statements
\(\Delta_{\mathrm{phys},L}(\xi)=3\kappa+O(\kappa\xi)\) and
\(\mathfrak m_L(\xi)=3\kappa+O(\kappa\xi)\), with the displayed
two-sided constants as their meaning. It does not assert that
every signed state's quotient is near \(3\kappa\).
In particular it does not replace the parent's fixed-box
fourth-order kernel quotient or prove its remainder uniform.
The separate calculation (16.17)--(16.24) supplies that uniform
remainder on the entire original incidence kernel.
The earlier two-sided nonnegative/native estimate (14.7) also
remains valid with its original range.
In physical parameters the range of (15.21) is
\(g_{\rm YM}^4\ge170000\) and its central scale is
\(3\kappa=6g_{\rm YM}^2/a\).
No lattice-spacing limit or coupling continuation is taken.

## 15.5. The physical conditional-complement operator

Retain \(J_S,Q_S^\rho,\mathscr K_S^\rho,U_\psi,q_\rho\) and their
domains from Section 10. Let the gauge group act on
\(\mathscr H_\rho\) by the same pullback (15.1). It is unitary
because \(\rho=\psi^2\) is invariant. The retained-variable space
has the induced endpoint action on its retained links.
Under a simultaneous transformation of \((s,r)\), invariance of
\(\rho(s,r)\) and Haar measure in \(s\) proves invariance of the
marginal \(\rho_{S^c}(r)\). Changing variables in the conditional
integral then gives
\[
J_S^*\mathsf T_g=\mathsf T_{g,S^c}J_S^*,\qquad
\mathsf T_gJ_S=J_S\mathsf T_{g,S^c}.                          \tag{15.22}
\]
It follows that \(Q_S^\rho\) and the gauge projection commute.
They preserve the form domain as proved in Section 10 and by
the isometric gauge action. Averaging smooth approximants over
the compact gauge group and then applying \(Q_S^\rho\) proves
form density of the smooth invariant conditional-mean-zero
vectors in
\[
\mathscr K_{S,\mathrm{phys}}^\rho
 =\mathscr K_S^\rho\cap\mathscr H_\rho^{\mathcal G_L}.
\]
The closed form restricted to
\(H^1\cap\mathscr K_{S,\mathrm{phys}}^\rho\) therefore defines a
self-adjoint operator \(C_{S,\mathrm{phys}}^\rho\) by exactly
the variational domain rule given for \(C_S^\rho\) in Section 10.
Equations (15.22) and invariance of \(q_\rho\) also show that this
is the reducing physical restriction of \(C_S^\rho\).

The exact unitary \(U_\psi G=\psi G\) intertwines the gauge
representations. For a conditional-mean-zero \(G\), Fubini gives
\(\int G\rho\,dU=0\); consequently \(U_\psi G\) is physical and
perpendicular to \(\psi\) when \(G\) is invariant.
Apply (15.13) under this unitary and the form identity (10.10):
\[
C_{S,\mathrm{phys}}^\rho
 \ge3\kappa(1-512\xi/3)I\ge\frac{287\kappa}{96}I,
\qquad
\|(C_{S,\mathrm{phys}}^\rho)^{-1}\|
 \le\frac1{3\kappa(1-512\xi/3)}
 \le\frac{96}{287\kappa}.                                    \tag{15.23}
\]
This holds for every nonempty eliminated set \(S\), independently
of its size and the exterior volume, on (11.16). It concerns the
full form with derivatives in all link directions, not a
differential operator containing only the eliminated derivatives.
For noninvariant conditional-mean-zero vectors the previously
proved constants (12.15)--(12.16), not (15.23), remain the stated
bounds. The mathematical distinction is implemented by the
proved reducing projection and unitary, not by declaring the
two constructions unrelated.

# 16. Uniform fourth-order forms on the entire signed incidence kernel

Retain the full Hamiltonian (1.2), its actual positive unit vacuum
\(\psi\), \(A=H-\mathcal E\), the gauge constraint (15.1), and every
original real edge weight. Throughout this section
\(0<\xi\le1/49152\), unless an explicitly smaller interval is displayed.
Write \(\mathscr Z_L=\ker\mathsf I\). We prove volume-uniform remainders
for the first surviving covariance and energy forms on all of
\(\mathscr Z_L\), not merely on one alternating weight.

The exact two-face coefficients are the existing calculation in the
parent source
\nolinkurl{wilson_variation/ELECTRIC_COVARIANCE_UNSIGNED_INCIDENCE_20260908.md},
Sections 4--5, equations (4.1)--(5.8). The source's electric operator
denoted \(H_0\) there is \(\sum_eE_e\); our \(H_0\) in (11.1) is
\(\kappa\sum_eE_e\). Accordingly define here
\(\mathfrak h_0=\sum_eE_e\), so \(H_0=\kappa\mathfrak h_0\), on
the same domain. Every occurrence of a physical energy below retains
\(\kappa=2g_{\rm YM}^2/a\). No change of Hamiltonian or vacuum is made.
We first record the two-face functions and their exact derivative
dictionary needed for the new remainder calculation.

## 16.1. The retained two-face modes and a local correction function

Let \(\mathscr P_2\) be the unordered pairs of distinct elementary
faces sharing a link. Their unique shared link is \(e(p,q)\);
their other six links form the set \(O(p,q)\). Write
\[
R_{pq}=\operatorname{tr}(A_{pq}B_{pq}),\qquad
D_{pq}=W_pW_q-\tfrac12R_{pq},\qquad
G_{pq}=\nabla_{e(p,q)}W_p\cdot\nabla_{e(p,q)}W_q .
\]
Here the original face words, cyclically based at the shared link,
are \(U_eA_{pq}\) and \(U_e^{-1}B_{pq}\), reversing a full face
traversal when necessary. The trace is unchanged under that full
reversal in \(SU(2)\). The words \(A_{pq},B_{pq}\) contain the six
distinct outer links with the original inherited inverse occurrences.
No individual inverse occurrence is dropped.

The Pauli contraction with \(T_a=-i\sigma_a/2\) is
\[
\sum_a\operatorname{tr}(T_aC)\operatorname{tr}(T_aD)
 =-\tfrac12\operatorname{tr}(CD)
   +\tfrac14\operatorname{tr}C\operatorname{tr}D .
\]
Inserting the minus sign from differentiation of the inverse shared
link proves the first identity below. The product rule for \(E_e\)
then proves the shared-link label \(2\) of \(D_{pq}\):
\[
\begin{split}
G_{pq}&=\tfrac38R_{pq}-\tfrac14D_{pq},\\
\mathfrak h_0R_{pq}&=\tfrac92R_{pq},\qquad
\mathfrak h_0D_{pq}=\tfrac{13}{2}D_{pq},\\
\|R_{pq}\|_0^2&=1,\qquad
\|D_{pq}\|_0^2=\tfrac34,\qquad
\langle R_{pq},D_{pq}\rangle_0=0 .
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.1}
\]
The subscript \(0\) denotes the original full product Haar measure,
used to compute coefficients, not substituted for the physical density.
Indeed each outer link has Casimir \(3/4\) on both functions;
on the shared link \(R_{pq}\) has Casimir zero. The identity
\(E_e(W_pW_q)=2D_{pq}\) follows from the displayed Pauli
contraction, and gives the remaining Casimir label.

For completeness, the norms in (16.1) can be checked by conditioning
on the shared link. The two disjoint outer words are independent
Haar matrices. Specifically take \(P=U_eA_{pq}\) and
\(Q=B_{pq}U_e^{-1}\); then \(\operatorname{tr}(PQ)=R_{pq}\)
and \(\operatorname{tr}P\operatorname{tr}Q=W_pW_q\).
For these independent holonomies
\(P=p_0I+i p_a\sigma_a,\ Q=q_0I+i q_a\sigma_a\), put
\(x=p_0q_0,\ y=\sum_{a=1}^3p_aq_a\). Their uniform unit-sphere
second moments give
\(\mathbb E x^2=1/16,\ \mathbb E y^2=3/16,\ \mathbb E xy=0\).
Now \(R=2(x-y)\) and \(D=3x+y\); multiplying these expressions
proves all three Haar products in (16.1).
Their individual Haar means are zero, by integration in an outer
fundamental link.

The functions \(R_{pq},D_{pq}\), for all unordered pairs, are
mutually orthogonal except for their own squared norms.
Here is the geometric check retained from the parent. A coplanar
pair has a \(2\)-by-\(1\) rectangular outer boundary, which determines
its two unit faces. A perpendicular pair has a unit-cube bounding box;
the two vertices absent from its outer six-cycle form the edge
opposite the shared edge. They determine that shared edge and the
two faces. The two cases have respectively two and three nonzero
coordinate spans. Thus different pairs have different outer supports.
Two \(R\)'s then have a \(3/4\)-versus-zero link label somewhere.
An \(R\) and a \(D\) differ at the latter's label-\(2\) link.
Two \(D\)'s differ either at that label-\(2\) link or at an outer
link. Self-adjointness of the differing link Casimir proves the
claimed orthogonality in every case.

For a physical link \(e\) and pair \(\{p,q\}\), define the exact
real coefficient
\[
\begin{split}
c_{e;pq}=-\mathbf1_{\{e=e(p,q)\}}
              +\tfrac16\mathbf1_{\{e\in O(p,q)\}},&\\
F_e=\sum_{\{p,q\}\in\mathscr P_2}c_{e;pq}G_{pq},\qquad&\\
\mathcal B_e=\sum_{\{p,q\}\in\mathscr P_2}c_{e;pq}
          \left(\tfrac1{12}R_{pq}-\tfrac1{26}D_{pq}\right).&
\end{split}
                                                               \tag{16.2}
\]
Equation (16.1) proves \(\mathfrak h_0\mathcal B_e=F_e\)
and \(\int\mathcal B_e\,dU=0\).
These functions are bounded, real, smooth and gauge invariant.
They are not truncated Hamiltonians.

Every contributing pair has \(e\) in at least one of its faces.
There are at most four such faces and at most twelve adjacent
faces for each, giving at most \(48\) pairs. Their link union
lies in the shared-face graph ball of radius two about \(e\).
Each radius-one ball has at most \(13\) links, so a radius-two
ball is contained in a union of \(13\) such balls and has at
most \(169\) links.
The pointwise bounds are
\[
\|\mathcal B_e\|_\infty\le24,\qquad
\sum_f\|\nabla_f\mathcal B_e\|_\infty\le168.                  \tag{16.3}
\]
To verify the constants, \(|R|\le2,\ |D|\le5\).
On an outer link \(|\nabla R|\le1\) and
\(|\nabla D|\le2+1/2=5/2\), using (6.2) and the product rule.
On the shared link \(\nabla R=0,\ |\nabla D|\le4\).
The absolute value of a shared-coefficient summand in (16.2)
is at most \(2/12+5/26<1/2\). Its derivative at any one
of its seven links is at most
\(\max\{1/12+(5/2)/26,4/26\}<1/2\).
An outer-coefficient summand is a further factor \(1/6\) smaller.
Summing at most \(48\) summands and seven derivative locations
proves (16.3).

## 16.2. A full-vacuum third-order state residual

Set \(h_e=W_e^\star/4\), which is a function, and put
\(d_e=E_e\psi-\xi h_e\psi\). Section 4 gives
\(\|d_e\|\le4200\xi^2\).
We need its differentiated counterpart, not a derivative of a norm
estimate. Introduce \(f_e=\psi-(\xi/3)W_e^\star\psi\).
The exact product rule gives
\[
E_ef_e=d_e-\tfrac{\xi}{3}W_e^\star E_e\psi
                         +\tfrac{2\xi}{3}D_e\psi .
\]
Here \(D_e\) is the differential contraction of Section 6,
not the two-face function \(D_{pq}\).
Equations (3.1), (10.5) and (6.2) give
\(\|E_e\psi\|\le8\xi,\ \|\nabla_e\psi\|\le8\xi,\
\|D_e\psi\|\le32\xi\).
Thus
\(\|E_ef_e\|\le(4200+128/3)\xi^2=(12728/3)\xi^2\).
The exact one-link spectral inequality
\(\|\nabla_ef\|\le(2/\sqrt3)\|E_ef\|\) holds also when
\(f\) has a constant component. Apply it to \(f_e\) and retain
the product-rule remainder:
\[
\begin{split}
\left\|\nabla_e\psi-\tfrac{\xi}{3}
                    (\nabla_eW_e^\star)\psi\right\|
&\le\frac{2}{\sqrt3}\frac{12728}{3}\xi^2
                              +\frac{64}{3}\xi^2\\
&<5000\xi^2 .
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.4}
\]
For the last numerical inequality use \(2/\sqrt3<7/6\);
the resulting coefficient is \(44740/9<5000\).
All differentiations are on the actual smooth vacuum.

From (6.1) and the full ground-state product rule,
\[
Ad_e=\kappa\xi\left[
 -2D_e\psi+\tfrac12
   \sum_{p\ni e}\sum_{f\in\partial p}
          \nabla_fW_p\cdot\nabla_f\psi\right].
                                                               \tag{16.5}
\]
Insert (16.4) for each differentiated vacuum. The error from
the first term has norm at most \(2\cdot4\cdot5000\kappa\xi^3\).
The error from the second has norm at most
\((1/2)\cdot4\cdot4\cdot5000\kappa\xi^3\).
The full leading function is exactly \(F_e\) of (16.2).
To check every cancellation, a repeated face contributes
\(-2/3\) from the first sum and \(4/6\) from the second, hence zero.
An unordered distinct pair with shared link \(e\) contributes
\(-4/3+2/6=-1\); a pair with \(e\) on its outer boundary
contributes \(1/6\). These are precisely \(c_{e;pq}\).
Consequently
\[
\|Ad_e-\kappa\xi^2F_e\psi\|\le80000\kappa\xi^3.               \tag{16.6}
\]

Define the original local differential observable and its centered
residual state by
\[
\mathscr D_e=E_e-\xi h_e-\xi^2\mathcal B_e,\qquad
s_e=Q_\psi\mathscr D_e\psi,\qquad
Q_\psi=I-|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|.                            \tag{16.7}
\]
It is a bounded real multiplication perturbation of \(E_e\),
with the same one-link operator domain tensored with the exterior
space. It is self-adjoint on that domain; every product below is
first evaluated on smooth \(\psi\). The vector is gauge invariant,
real, smooth and perpendicular to the same \(\psi\).
Since
\[
A(\mathcal B_e\psi)
 =\kappa F_e\psi
       -2\kappa\sum_f\nabla_f\mathcal B_e\cdot\nabla_f\psi ,
\]
the last term has norm at most
\(2\kappa\cdot168\cdot8\xi=2688\kappa\xi\).
Equations (16.6)--(16.7), including the exact centering killed by
\(A\), imply
\[
\|As_e\|\le82688\kappa\xi^3<83000\kappa\xi^3,\qquad
\|s_e\|\le28000\xi^3.                                       \tag{16.8}
\]
The second assertion is the proved physical inverse bound
\(96/(287\kappa)\) from (15.13), applied to \(s_e\):
\(96\cdot83000/287<28000\). It is not obtained from an
assumed locality of the full vacuum.

## 16.3. Exact finite-range residual energy and its extensive consequence

The support of \(\mathscr D_e\) is inside the radius-two link
ball about \(e\). The commutator \([H,\mathscr D_f]\) has support
inside the radius-two ball about \(f\) as well. Indeed
\([H,E_f]\) uses only the faces at \(f\), while the commutator
of \(H\) with either multiplication function in (16.7) contains
only that function's derivatives on its own link support.
All multiplication potentials commute with those functions.
No distant coefficient is generated by these exact commutators.

Let \(\mathcal S_{ef}=\langle s_e,As_f\rangle\). Expanding the
double commutator on the smooth vacuum gives
\[
\mathcal S_{ef}
 =\tfrac12\langle\psi,[\mathscr D_e,[H,\mathscr D_f]]\psi\rangle,
\qquad
\mathcal S_{ef}=0\quad\text{when }d(e,f)>4.                  \tag{16.9}
\]
For the first identity no commutation of
\(\mathscr D_e,\mathscr D_f\) is assumed. The expansion equals
\(\langle\mathscr D_e\psi,A\mathscr D_f\psi\rangle+
 \langle\mathscr D_f\psi,A\mathscr D_e\psi\rangle\);
the two terms are equal because all functions and differential
operators are real and \(A\) is self-adjoint. Centering changes
neither term. For the second identity the two indicated supports
are disjoint, so their differential operators commute on the
smooth domain.

The radius-four link ball has at most \(17^3=4913\) vertices
by the unchanged coordinate map of Section 14. Equation (16.8)
gives
\(|\mathcal S_{ef}|\le28000\cdot83000\kappa\xi^6\).
The symmetric row-sum estimate used in (6.6) now gives, for every
real weight \(w\), with \(s_w=\sum_e w_es_e\),
\[
0\le\mathfrak q_A[s_w]\le10^{14}\kappa\xi^6\|w\|_2^2,
\qquad
\|s_w\|\le6\cdot10^6\xi^3\|w\|_2.                           \tag{16.10}
\]
The exact row coefficient is
\(4913\cdot28000\cdot83000=11417812000000<10^{14}\).
Applying (15.13) once more bounds the squared norm by
\((96/287)10^{14}\xi^6\|w\|_2^2\);
\((96/287)10^{14}<(6\cdot10^6)^2\).
This is the step which removes the number of nonzero weights
from the residual estimate. The physical \(s_w\) and its full
energy form remain unchanged.

## 16.4. Uniform covariance and energy estimates for the correction functions

Put
\[
u_e=Q_\psi\mathcal B_e\psi,\qquad
\mathcal C^{B}_{ef}=\langle u_e,u_f\rangle,\qquad
\mathcal C^{B,0}_{ef}=\langle\mathcal B_e,\mathcal B_f\rangle_0 .
\]
Each \(\mathcal B_e\) uses at most \(169\) links, and a product
uses at most \(338\). Equations (3.2)--(3.3), with
\(32\sqrt{169}/3<139\) and \(32\sqrt{338}/3<197\),
give
\[
|\langle\mathcal B_e\rangle_\psi|\le7000\xi,\qquad
|\mathcal C^B_{ef}-\mathcal C^{B,0}_{ef}|\le230000\xi .
                                                               \tag{16.11}
\]
In detail, the first coefficient is at most
\(48\cdot139(1+139/49152)<7000\).
For the second use the product bound \(24^2=576\), and retain
the product of the two means. The coefficient is at most
\[
2\cdot576\cdot197+
 \frac{2\cdot576\cdot197^2+7000^2}{49152}
 =\frac{175757179}{768}<230000.
\]
This controls every pair locally; it does not yet sum all pairs.

We also require the large-distance bound
\[
|\mathcal C^B_{ef}|\le10000e^{-d(e,f)/4}
\quad\text{when }d(e,f)\ge5.                                \tag{16.12}
\]
Here is the support-dependent version of the method in Section 13.
For bounded \(O_X,O_Y\) on disjoint link sets, the exact recurrence
(13.6) has the initial term
\(2\|O_X\|\|O_Y\|\mathbf1_{X\cap Y\ne\varnothing}\).
The first face in an iterated chain has at most \(4|X|\)
choices; each later face has at most \(16\) choices. Reaching
\(Y\) requires at least \(d(X,Y)\) faces. The same strong
evolution and factorial-remainder proof therefore gives
\[
\|[\alpha_t(O_X),O_Y]\|
 \le2|X|\|O_X\|\|O_Y\|
      e^{-d(X,Y)}(e^{192b|t|}-1).                            \tag{16.13}
\]
The extra factor is the explicitly counted \(|X|\), not the
volume of the full box or an assumed single-link estimate for
a multi-link observable. This is the crossing-set construction
of Nachtergaele--Sims, arXiv:1410.8174v1, Section 3, equations
fbd, iterandum and the complete Step 4; the original proof has
been read directly in the retained TeX.

For \(\mathcal B_e,\mathcal B_f\), take \(X,Y\) their actual
supports and set \(s=d(e,f)-4\ge1\), so \(d(X,Y)\ge s\).
Repeat the explicitly evaluated Gaussian filter (13.7), now with
the \(|X|\) in (16.13), and take
\(T=s/(\Delta_*+2v)\),
\(\Delta_*=287\kappa/384,\ v=192b\).
The spectral-integral proof is unchanged because its only
observable hypotheses are boundedness and self-adjointness.
This is the method of Nachtergaele--Sims,
arXiv:math-ph/0506030v3, Section 3.2; its spectral and Gaussian
integral proof is read and retained, not inferred from a title.
The numerical estimates (13.8) give \(vT<s/100\) and
\(\Delta_*T\ge287s/290\). Since \(|X|\le169\) and
\(\|u_e\|\|u_f\|\le576\), the two terms of the filter are at most
\[
\frac{576\cdot169}{100}s\,e^{-99s/100}
       +1728e^{-s/4}
 \le\left(\frac{576\cdot169}{74}+1728\right)e^{-s/4}.
\]
We used \(s e^{-74s/100}\le100/74\), proved by
\(\exp(x)\ge x\), and \(2/\pi<1\).
Finally \(e^{-s/4}=\exp(1)e^{-d(e,f)/4}<3e^{-d(e,f)/4}\);
the resulting coefficient \(337824/37<10000\) proves (16.12).

For \(d(e,f)>4\), the two correction functions have disjoint
supports and zero individual Haar means, so
\(\mathcal C^{B,0}_{ef}=0\) by Fubini. Use (16.11) up to
integer distance \(D\) and (16.12) outside it. With the
generating function \(G\) already explicitly evaluated in
(14.2), define
\[
\begin{split}
\mathcal P_B(z)&=230000(16z+5)^3+10000G(16z+9,4/5),\\
r_B(\xi)&=\xi\mathcal P_B(\log(1/\xi)).
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.14}
\]
Take \(D=\lceil4\log(1/\xi)\rceil\), which is at least four
on the present interval. The same coordinate shell count gives
\[
\begin{split}
\sup_e\sum_f|\mathcal C^B_{ef}-\mathcal C^{B,0}_{ef}|
&\le230000\xi(4D+1)^3
       +10000\sum_{n>D}(4n+1)^3e^{-n/4}\\
&\le r_B(\xi).
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.15}
\]
Indeed \(e^{-D/4}\le\xi\), \(4D+1\le16\log(1/\xi)+5\),
and \(4D+5\le16\log(1/\xi)+9\); (14.2) evaluates the full
tail. The symmetric row and column bound also bounds the
\(\ell^2\) operator norm, by the weighted Cauchy--Schwarz
proof following (14.4). Thus (16.15) applies to arbitrary
extensive real weights without an \(\ell^1\) loss.

For energy, retain the exact multiplication-state form
\[
\mathcal E^B_{ef}
 =\mathfrak q_A[u_e,u_f]
 =\kappa\int \rho\sum_h
       \nabla_h\mathcal B_e\cdot\nabla_h\mathcal B_f\,dU .
\]
Its Haar counterpart is
\(\mathcal E^{B,0}_{ef}
 =\kappa\langle\mathcal B_e,\mathfrak h_0\mathcal B_f\rangle_0\),
by integration by parts. Both matrices vanish when \(d(e,f)>4\).
The multiplier in the integral has sup norm at most \(168^2=28224\)
and support size at most \(338\). Formula (3.3) bounds the
coefficient of its expectation difference by
\[
2\cdot28224\cdot197(1+197/49152)
=\frac{1429097691}{128}<12000000.
\]
The same radius-four row count proves, for all real \(w\),
\[
|w^{\mathsf T}(\mathcal E^B-\mathcal E^{B,0})w|
\le6\cdot10^{10}\kappa\xi\|w\|_2^2 .                         \tag{16.16}
\]
The exact row coefficient \(4913\cdot12000000=58956000000\)
is smaller than the stated constant.

## 16.5. The full kernel identity and its uniform fourth-order remainder

For \(w\in\mathscr Z_L\), the two face sums vanish separately.
Thus the sum of its six outer weights at each adjacent pair is
\(-2w_{e(p,q)}\). Substituting in (16.2) gives the exact
function identity
\[
\mathcal B_w:=\sum_e w_e\mathcal B_e
 =\sum_{\{p,q\}\in\mathscr P_2}w_{e(p,q)}
         \left(-\tfrac19R_{pq}+\tfrac2{39}D_{pq}\right)
 =S_w .                                                     \tag{16.17}
\]
Indeed the summed \(c_{e;pq}\) is
\(-w_{e(p,q)}+(1/6)(-2w_{e(p,q)})=-4w_{e(p,q)}/3\).
This is precisely the parent's surviving two-face function;
the present calculation has not chosen a different weight
family or discarded one of its Casimir components.

Define
\[
\mathcal K_L(w,z)=\sum_e\binom{r_e}{2}w_ez_e,\qquad
d_0=\frac{196}{13689},\qquad e_0=\frac8{117}.
\]
Since \(2\le r_e\le4\),
\(\|w\|_2^2\le\mathcal K_L(w,w)\le6\|w\|_2^2\).
The orthogonality in (16.1) gives exactly
\[
\|\mathcal B_w\|_0^2=d_0\mathcal K_L(w,w),\qquad
\kappa\langle\mathcal B_w,\mathfrak h_0\mathcal B_w\rangle_0
=\kappa e_0\mathcal K_L(w,w).                                \tag{16.18}
\]
The retained component sums are
\(d_0=1/81+(3/4)(4/1521)\) and
\(e_0=(9/2)/81+(13/2)(3/4)(4/1521)\).
Each pair is counted once through its unique shared link.

The first-order term in (16.7) cancels exactly on
\(\mathscr Z_L\), because
\(\sum_e w_eh_e=(1/4)\sum_p(\mathsf Iw)_pW_p=0\).
Consequently the actual centered state satisfies
\[
v_w=\xi^2u_w+s_w,\qquad
u_w=Q_\psi\mathcal B_w\psi,\qquad
s_w=\sum_e w_es_e,\qquad w\in\mathscr Z_L.                   \tag{16.19}
\]
Both terms on the right are physical vectors of the full
interacting Hilbert space, on the domains used above.

Set the explicit positive errors
\[
\begin{split}
\varepsilon_C(\xi)
 &=r_B(\xi)+12\cdot10^6\xi\sqrt{6d_0+r_B(\xi)}
                              +36\cdot10^{12}\xi^2,\\
\varepsilon_N(\xi)
 &=6\cdot10^{10}\xi
   +2\cdot10^7\xi\sqrt{6e_0+6\cdot10^{10}\xi}
                              +10^{14}\xi^2.
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.20}
\]
Then, simultaneously for every original box and every
real \(w\in\mathscr Z_L\),
\[
\begin{split}
\left|\|v_w\|^2-d_0\xi^4\mathcal K_L(w,w)\right|
 &\le\xi^4\varepsilon_C(\xi)\|w\|_2^2,\\
\left|\mathfrak q_A[v_w]
             -\kappa e_0\xi^4\mathcal K_L(w,w)\right|
 &\le\kappa\xi^4\varepsilon_N(\xi)\|w\|_2^2 .
\end{split}                                                  \tag{16.21}
\]
Here is the complete error calculation. Equations (16.15),(16.18)
give
\[
\left|\|u_w\|^2-d_0\mathcal K_L(w,w)\right|
\le r_B(\xi)\|w\|_2^2,\qquad
\|u_w\|\le\sqrt{6d_0+r_B(\xi)}\,\|w\|_2.
\]
Expand the squared norm of (16.19). Its cross term is at most
\(2\xi^2\|u_w\|\|s_w\|\), and its residual square is
\(\|s_w\|^2\). Substitution of (16.10) yields exactly the
first line of (16.20), with no hidden weight-dependent constant.

For energy, (16.16),(16.18) give
\[
\left|\mathfrak q_A[u_w]-\kappa e_0\mathcal K_L(w,w)\right|
 \le6\cdot10^{10}\kappa\xi\|w\|_2^2,\qquad
\mathfrak q_A[u_w]\le
 \kappa(6e_0+6\cdot10^{10}\xi)\|w\|_2^2.
\]
The nonnegative form satisfies Cauchy--Schwarz: apply ordinary
Cauchy--Schwarz to \(A^{1/2}u_w,A^{1/2}s_w\).
Thus the energy cross term in (16.19) is at most
\(2\xi^2\sqrt{\mathfrak q_A[u_w]\mathfrak q_A[s_w]}\).
Use (16.10), whose square-root coefficient is \(10^7\).
The residual energy contributes \(10^{14}\kappa\xi^6\|w\|_2^2\).
These are exactly the three terms in \(\varepsilon_N\), proving
the second line of (16.21).

Both errors tend to zero as \(\xi\downarrow0\).
Indeed \(\mathcal P_B\) is a fixed cubic with positive coefficients,
so \(\xi\mathcal P_B(\log(1/\xi))\to0\);
each remaining displayed term then tends to zero.
More explicitly, (16.21) gives a covariance remainder
\(O(\xi^5(1+\log(1/\xi))^3)\|w\|_2^2\) and an energy
remainder \(O(\kappa\xi^5)\|w\|_2^2\), with constants independent
of \(L,w\). These real-coupling estimates do not assert that the
fixed-box even Taylor expansion has a nonzero fifth-order term.
The parent's \(O_L(\xi^6)\) expansion remains true on its stated
fixed-box interval; its constant is not silently promoted to a
uniform one.

## 16.6. Nonzero kernel states and the uniform two-face energy quotient

The explicit interval
\[
0<\xi\le10^{-24}                                             \tag{16.22}
\]
has \(\varepsilon_C(\xi)<d_0/2\).
To check this without a numerical logarithm, put \(z=\log(1/\xi)\).
The positive-coefficient cubic \(\mathcal P_B\) has
\(e^{-z}\mathcal P_B(z)\) nonincreasing for \(z\ge3\);
differentiate each monomial \(e^{-z}z^k\), \(0\le k\le3\).
At the largest allowed \(\xi\), \(24<24\log10<72\), using
the exponential-series bounds \(e<10<e^3\).
The exact polynomial value is
\[
\mathcal P_B(72)=437811569040000 .
\]
It follows for all of (16.22) that
\[
r_B(\xi)\le
\frac{437811569040000}{10^{24}}<10^{-9},\qquad
6d_0+r_B(\xi)<1.
\]
The second and third terms of \(\varepsilon_C\) are therefore
bounded by \(12\cdot10^6/10^{24}\) and
\(36\cdot10^{12}/10^{48}\).
Their sum with the displayed rational bound is less than
\(10^{-9}<d_0/2\); every number in this comparison is rational.
This conservative interval is explicit, not asserted optimal.

For every nonzero real \(w\in\mathscr Z_L\), (16.21) now proves
\[
\|v_w\|^2\ge\xi^4(d_0-\varepsilon_C(\xi))\|w\|_2^2
 \ge\tfrac12d_0\xi^4\|w\|_2^2>0.                             \tag{16.23}
\]
The exact state map (15.18) is therefore injective on the
entire incidence kernel throughout the same volume-independent
interval. Its restriction is a bijection onto its image, and
(16.23) bounds its inverse, in the original edge norm and
physical state norm, by
\(\xi^{-2}\sqrt{2/d_0}\). Neither the weights nor the state
has been rescaled in that assertion.

Finally \(e_0/d_0=234/49\). Subtract
\((234/49)\kappa\) times the first line of (16.21) from the
second before dividing by the strictly positive bound (16.23).
The leading \(\mathcal K_L(w,w)\) terms cancel with their exact
coefficients. The result is
\[
\left|
 \frac{\mathfrak q_A[v_w]}{\|v_w\|^2}
          -\frac{234}{49}\kappa
\right|
\le
\kappa\,
\frac{\varepsilon_N(\xi)+(234/49)\varepsilon_C(\xi)}
     {d_0-\varepsilon_C(\xi)}
\quad
\left(0\ne w\in\mathscr Z_L,\ 0<\xi\le10^{-24}\right).
                                                               \tag{16.24}
\]
Its right-hand coefficient tends to zero independently of the
box and of every signed, volume-dependent or coupling-dependent
kernel weight. This proves the uniform first surviving
two-face quotient of the actual states, retaining both free
Casimir components only as coefficients of the full-vacuum
calculation.

The minimum over all signed actual states in (15.21) and the
kernel quotients in (16.24) describe the same state map on
different explicitly specified domains. Their central energies
are \(3\kappa\) and \((234/49)\kappa\); the difference
\((234/49-3)\kappa=(87/49)\kappa>0\) is explicit.
No implication of unrelatedness is drawn: (16.17)--(16.19) prove
the exact cancellation map and the surviving physical vectors.
The present injectivity assertion is on \(\mathscr Z_L\);
it is not a proof that \(\ker C=\{0\}\) on the entire edge space
for a uniform coupling interval.
Section 17 proves that stronger statement by controlling the mixed
one-face and two-face coefficient covariance; it does not infer it
from the kernel restriction.
The physical parameters remain
\(\xi=1/(4g_{\rm YM}^4)\), \(\kappa=2g_{\rm YM}^2/a\).
Interval (16.22) is \(g_{\rm YM}^4\ge250000000000000000000000\).
No spatial continuum construction, interchange of limits, or
Millennium conclusion is asserted by these finite-regulator
strong-coupling estimates.

# 17. Mixed face coordinates and uniform injectivity on the full edge space

We retain the same actual vacuum and all real edge weights, without
restricting to \(\ker\mathsf I\). The local residual construction of
Section 16 already applies to these weights. Its remaining leading
function contains both the one-face and two-face coordinates. We now
control their complete mixed covariance. Throughout
\(0<\xi\le1/49152\); the smaller interval used for a positive lower
bound will be stated separately.

## 17.1. Exact coefficient map, image and inverse

For each unordered adjacent pair \(\alpha=\{p,q\}\), put
\[
f_p=W_p,\qquad
f_\alpha=\tfrac1{12}R_{pq}-\tfrac1{26}D_{pq},\qquad
b_0=\tfrac1{144}+\tfrac3{4\cdot676}=\frac{49}{6084}.
\]
The index set is the disjoint union
\(\mathscr J_L=\mathsf P_L\sqcup\mathscr P_2\). These are real,
gauge-invariant smooth functions with zero Haar means, supported on
at most seven original links and of absolute value at most two.
The pair functions in fact have absolute value less than \(1/2\),
by the constants in (16.3).
For different faces the Wilson functions are orthogonal by integration
in a link appearing in only one face. Each has squared norm one.
Every one-face function is orthogonal to every \(R_{pq}\): their
four- and six-link fundamental supports differ. It is orthogonal
to every \(D_{pq}\), whose shared link has Casimir two rather than
zero or \(3/4\). Together with (16.1), these facts prove the entire
Haar Gram matrix, including its mixed blocks:
\[
\langle f_j,f_k\rangle_0=
\begin{cases}
1,&j=k\in\mathsf P_L,\\
b_0,&j=k\in\mathscr P_2,\\
0,&j\ne k.
\end{cases}                                                   \tag{17.1}
\]

For the original weight \(w\in\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}\), define
\[
\begin{split}
z_p&=(\mathsf Iw)_p,\\
c_\alpha&=\tfrac16(z_p+z_q)-\tfrac43w_{e(p,q)},\\
\mathsf T_\xi w&=a,\qquad
a_p=\tfrac{\xi}{4}z_p,\quad a_\alpha=\xi^2c_\alpha,\\
F_w&=\sum_{j\in\mathscr J_L}a_j f_j
     =\xi h_w+\xi^2\mathcal B_w .
\end{split}                                                   \tag{17.2}
\]
The formula for \(c_\alpha\) follows by summing the coefficients
in (16.2): the six outer weights sum to \(z_p+z_q-2w_e\).
Thus no term of \(\mathcal B_w\) is lost.
The exact state identity for all weights is
\[
v_w=Q_\psi F_w\psi+s_w .                                     \tag{17.3}
\]

Every link has at least two incident faces. Fix the lexicographically
first pair \(\alpha_e=\{p_e,q_e\}\) of them, using the original
integer face labels. On the whole coefficient space define
\[
\begin{split}
\mathsf L_\xi:\mathbb R^{\mathscr J_L}&\longrightarrow
                         \mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L},\\
(\mathsf L_\xi a)_e
 &=\frac{a_{p_e}+a_{q_e}}{2\xi}
                   -\frac{3a_{\alpha_e}}{4\xi^2}.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{17.4}
\]
Substitution of (17.2) gives
\((z_{p_e}+z_{q_e})/8-3c_{\alpha_e}/4=w_e\).
Consequently \(\mathsf L_\xi\mathsf T_\xi=I\) exactly,
\(\ker\mathsf T_\xi=\{0\}\), and
\(\mathsf T_\xi\mathsf L_\xi\) is an idempotent with image
\(\operatorname{Ran}\mathsf T_\xi\). A coefficient array \(a\)
lies in this image exactly when
\(a=\mathsf T_\xi\mathsf L_\xi a\). This is an explicit system
of linear equations, with inverse (17.4) on that image.
The powers of \(\xi\) belong to this recorded coefficient map;
the original physical state and its norm have not been changed.

Let \((\mathsf Jz)_\alpha=z_p+z_q\). Each face has at most twelve
adjacent faces, since its four links each meet at most three other
faces. Therefore
\[
\|\mathsf Jz\|_2^2
\le2\sum_{\{p,q\}\in\mathscr P_2}(z_p^2+z_q^2)
\le24\|z\|_2^2 .
\]
Using \(w_{e(p,q)}=(\mathsf Jz)_\alpha/8-3c_\alpha/4\)
at every pair, not only the selected pair, gives
\[
\|w\|_2^2\le\mathcal K_L(w,w)
\le\tfrac34\|z\|_2^2+\tfrac98\|c\|_2^2.                      \tag{17.5}
\]
Indeed \(|x+y|^2\le2|x|^2+2|y|^2\) gives the coefficients
\(24/32=3/4\) and \(18/16=9/8\).
Write \(d_0=196/13689\) as before. The exact Haar value is
\[
\begin{split}
\mathcal H_\xi(w):=\|F_w\|_0^2
 &=\tfrac{\xi^2}{16}\|\mathsf Iw\|_2^2
                         +b_0\xi^4\|c\|_2^2,\\
\mathcal H_\xi(w)&\ge\tfrac{d_0}{2}\xi^4\|w\|_2^2 .
\end{split}                                                   \tag{17.6}
\]
For the second inequality multiply (17.5) by
\((d_0/2)\xi^4\). The pair coefficients agree because
\(9d_0/16=b_0\), and the face coefficient is bounded by
\(\xi^2/16\), since \(\xi\le1\) and \(3d_0/8<1/16\).
No inverse singular value of \(\mathsf I\) was used.

## 17.2. The full actual-vacuum Gram matrix

Anchor each face \((n;i,j)\), \(i<j\), at link \((n,i)\);
anchor each pair at its unique shared link. At most two face
indices and at most six pair indices have the same anchor.
All supports lie in the radius-one link ball of their anchor.
Hence the number of indices whose anchors lie within distance
\(D\) of a fixed anchor is at most \(8(4D+1)^3\).

Put
\[
\mathsf G^\psi_{jk}
=\langle Q_\psi f_j\psi,Q_\psi f_k\psi\rangle,\qquad
\mathsf G^0_{jk}=\langle f_j,f_k\rangle_0 .
\]
Each support has at most seven links, and two supports together
have at most fourteen. In (3.2)--(3.3) use
\((32/3)\sqrt7<29\), \((32/3)\sqrt{14}<40\).
The means satisfy
\[
|\langle f_j\rangle_\psi|
\le116\xi(1+29\xi)<117\xi.
\]
The product has absolute value at most four. Keeping the
product of the means, the entrywise difference is bounded by
\[
|\mathsf G^\psi_{jk}-\mathsf G^0_{jk}|
\le\bigl[320+(12800+13689)/49152\bigr]\xi<400\xi.              \tag{17.7}
\]

For anchor distance \(d\ge3\), the supports are disjoint and
their distance is at least \(s=d-2\ge1\).
Apply the full-dynamics estimate (16.13) with \(|X|\le7\)
and \(\|f_j\|\|f_k\|\le4\), and the exact Gaussian integral
proof (13.7), retaining \(T=s/(\Delta_*+2v)\).
Here \(s_0\le4\). The two resulting terms are bounded by
\[
\frac{28}{100}s e^{-99s/100}+12e^{-s/4}
\le\left(\frac{28}{74}+12\right)e^{-s/4}.
\]
Since \(e^{1/2}<2\), this proves
\[
|\mathsf G^\psi_{jk}|\le32e^{-d/4}\qquad(d\ge3).             \tag{17.8}
\]
The constants follow from the same strong on-site evolution
and spectral integrals as in Section16.4, using the original
Nachtergaele--Sims source proofs cited there. No infinite-volume
Hamiltonian or tensorized correlated vacuum is assumed.

For \(d\ge3\), \(\mathsf G^0_{jk}=0\) also follows from disjoint
supports and zero Haar means. Define, with \(G\) from (14.2),
\[
\begin{split}
\mathcal P_{\mathrm{mix}}(z)
 &=8\left[400(16z+5)^3+32G(16z+9,4/5)\right],\\
\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)
 &=\xi\mathcal P_{\mathrm{mix}}(\log(1/\xi)).
\end{split}                                                   \tag{17.9}
\]
Taking \(D=\lceil4\log(1/\xi)\rceil\ge2\), summing (17.7)
inside and (17.8) outside, with the anchor multiplicity eight,
gives
\[
\sup_j\sum_k|\mathsf G^\psi_{jk}-\mathsf G^0_{jk}|
\le\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi),\qquad
\|\mathsf G^\psi-\mathsf G^0\|_{\ell^2\to\ell^2}
\le\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi).                                \tag{17.10}
\]
The summation is exactly
\(8[400\xi(4D+1)^3+32\sum_{n>D}(4n+1)^3e^{-n/4}]\).
Equation (14.2) evaluates its complete tail and
\(e^{-D/4}\le\xi\) proves (17.10).
The symmetric row/column argument of (14.4) proves the
operator-norm statement. Thus the mixed blocks have been
bounded, not set to zero in the actual density.

For \(a=\mathsf T_\xi w\), put
\[
\mathcal A_\xi(w)=\|a\|_2^2
 =\tfrac{\xi^2}{16}\|z\|_2^2+\xi^4\|c\|_2^2 .
\]
Equations (17.1) and (17.10) imply
\[
\left|\|Q_\psi F_w\psi\|^2-\mathcal H_\xi(w)\right|
\le\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w),\qquad
b_0\mathcal A_\xi(w)\le\mathcal H_\xi(w).                    \tag{17.11}
\]
In particular the following complete all-weight covariance
error keeps both coefficient arrays:
\[
\begin{split}
\left|\|v_w\|^2-\mathcal H_\xi(w)\right|
&\le \rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w)\\
&\quad+12\cdot10^6\xi^3\|w\|_2
 \sqrt{\mathcal H_\xi(w)+\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w)}\\
&\quad+36\cdot10^{12}\xi^6\|w\|_2^2 .
\end{split}                                                   \tag{17.12}
\]
This is the squared norm expansion of (17.3), the exact
bound (17.11), and the original residual norm (16.10).
It applies to signed, volume-dependent and coupling-dependent
weights, including mixtures approaching \(\ker\mathsf I\).

## 17.3. A positive uniform interval for every raw weight

On \(0<\xi\le10^{-24}\), the positive-coefficient cubic in
(17.9) gives
\(\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)\le10^{-24}\mathcal P_{\mathrm{mix}}(72)\),
by the monomial monotonicity and \(24<24\log10<72\) used in
Section16.6. Direct rational evaluation of (17.9) gives
\(\mathcal P_{\mathrm{mix}}(72)=7044756359040<10^{13}\), so
\[
\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}(\xi)<10^{-11}<b_0/4,\qquad
(24\cdot10^6\xi)^2<d_0/2 .                                 \tag{17.13}
\]
Both numerical comparisons are rational and hold on the
whole stated interval. Equations (17.11), (17.13) show
\(\|Q_\psi F_w\psi\|\ge(3/4)\sqrt{\mathcal H_\xi(w)}\),
since \(1-\rho_{\mathrm{mix}}/b_0>3/4>(3/4)^2\).
The second inequality in (17.13) and (16.10) give
\(\|s_w\|\le(1/4)\sqrt{d_0/2}\xi^2\|w\|_2\).
Use (17.6) in the reverse triangle inequality for (17.3).
For every real \(w\) the result is
\[
\boxed{\quad
\|v_w\|^2\ge\frac{d_0}{8}\xi^4\|w\|_2^2,\qquad
C(\xi)\ge\frac{d_0}{8}\xi^4 I_{\mathbb R^{\mathsf E_L}}
\quad(0<\xi\le10^{-24}).\quad}                               \tag{17.14}
\]
This is on the entire original edge space, uniformly in \(L\).
It strengthens, rather than substitutes for, the sharper
kernel lower bound (16.23).

The physical state map \(V_\xi:w\mapsto v_w\) of (15.18)
therefore has zero kernel on this interval and is bijective
onto its actual image, with inverse norm at most
\(\xi^{-2}\sqrt{8/d_0}\). An explicit inverse on that image is
\[
w=C(\xi)^{-1}
      \bigl(\langle v_e,v_w\rangle\bigr)_{e\in\mathsf E_L}.
                                                               \tag{17.15}
\]
Indeed the vector on the right before applying \(C^{-1}\)
is precisely \(Cw\). Inequality (17.14) proves existence of
this finite-matrix inverse, and the physical inverse-norm bound
follows directly by taking square roots in (17.14).
No identification of these vectors as individual eigenvectors
is made. The original signed minimum (15.21), kernel quotient
(16.24), and full mixed covariance (17.12) all refer to this
same injective state map on their stated intervals.
The original spacing \(a>0\), coupling \(g_{\rm YM}\) and every
Hamiltonian term remain unchanged. This calculation does not
take a spatial continuum limit or continue beyond the displayed
strong-coupling interval.

# 18. Complete mixed energy and the original electric-state Ritz spectrum

Write \(A=H-\mathcal E\), with exactly the Hamiltonian, domains and
actual vacuum of Section 1. The coefficients \(z,c,a=\mathsf T_\xi w\),
the function \(F_w\), and the positive quadratic form
\(\mathcal H_\xi(w)\) are those of Section 17. We first work on
\(0<\xi\le1/49152\), and then give an explicit smaller interval for
all quotients and ordered Ritz values. All weights remain the original
real link arrays; none is replaced by a unit vector or a different
choice of physical coefficients.

## 18.1. The complete coefficient energy matrix

For \(j,k\in\mathscr J_L\) define
\[
\mathsf K^\psi_{jk}
 =\kappa\int\psi^2\sum_e\nabla_e f_j\cdot\nabla_e f_k\,dU,
\qquad
\mathsf K^0_{jk}
 =\kappa\int\sum_e\nabla_e f_j\cdot\nabla_e f_k\,dU .       \tag{18.1}
\]
Equation (1.5), polarized over real smooth functions, proves that
\(\mathsf K^\psi\) is exactly the energy Gram matrix of
\(Q_\psi f_j\psi\). Centering contributes no derivative. Every
function and state here is smooth on the full compact link manifold,
so both the form and operator domains are available.

Haar integration by parts gives
\(\mathsf K^0_{jk}=\kappa\langle f_j,\mathfrak h_0f_k\rangle_0\).
Each \(W_p\) has free energy \(3\). For a pair, retaining the two
distinct eigenvalues in (16.1) gives
\[
\langle f_\alpha,\mathfrak h_0 f_\alpha\rangle_0
 =\frac{9/2}{144}+\frac{(13/2)(3/4)}{676}=\frac1{26}.
\]
The link-Casimir orthogonality proved in Sections16.1 and17.1
annuls every other Haar entry, including the face/pair entries.
Thus the entire coefficient matrix and its original-weight form are
\[
\begin{split}
\mathsf K^0_{jk}&=
\begin{cases}
3\kappa,&j=k\in\mathsf P_L,\\
\kappa/26,&j=k\in\mathscr P_2,\\
0,&j\ne k,
\end{cases}\\
\mathcal J_\xi(w)&:=\kappa^{-1}a^t\mathsf K^0a
 =\frac{3\xi^2}{16}\|z\|_2^2+\frac{\xi^4}{26}\|c\|_2^2,\\
3\mathcal H_\xi(w)&\le\mathcal J_\xi(w)
 \le q_*\mathcal H_\xi(w),\qquad q_*:=\frac{234}{49}.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.2}
\]
Indeed \((1/26)/b_0=234/49\), with the unchanged
\(b_0=49/6084\). These are Haar coefficient calculations, not a
replacement of the actual matrix \(\mathsf K^\psi\).

For a face, \(\sum_e\|\nabla_e f_p\|_\infty\le4\), by (6.2).
For a pair, the seven derivative bounds preceding (16.3) each
are less than \(1/2\); their sum is less than \(7/2<4\).
Consequently the real multiplier
\(M_{jk}=\sum_e\nabla_e f_j\cdot\nabla_e f_k\) has
\(\|M_{jk}\|_\infty\le16\). Its support has at most fourteen
links. Apply the actual local marginal estimate (3.3) with
\(q_S<40\xi\). It yields
\[
|\mathsf K^\psi_{jk}-\mathsf K^0_{jk}|
 \le1280\kappa\xi(1+40\xi)<1300\kappa\xi .                 \tag{18.3}
\]
If the anchors of \(j,k\) have link-graph distance greater than
two, their link supports are disjoint. Each summand in
\(M_{jk}\) then vanishes pointwise. Both energy entries, not
merely their difference, are zero. There are at most
\(8(4\cdot2+1)^3=8\cdot9^3\) indices at anchor distance at
most two from any one anchor. The exact row coefficient is
\(1300\cdot8\cdot9^3=7581600<8000000\). Put
\[
\chi_E(\xi)=8000000\xi.
\]
The symmetric row/column estimate therefore proves
\[
\begin{split}
\sup_j\sum_k|\mathsf K^\psi_{jk}-\mathsf K^0_{jk}|
 &\le\kappa\chi_E(\xi),\\
\|\mathsf K^\psi-\mathsf K^0\|_{\ell^2\to\ell^2}
 &\le\kappa\chi_E(\xi),\\
\left|\mathfrak q_A[Q_\psi F_w\psi]-\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)\right|
 &\le\kappa\chi_E(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w).
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.4}
\]
All actual mixed entries are retained in the left sides of
(18.3)--(18.4); their smallness was calculated from the vacuum.

Now use the exact identity (17.3), not an identification with
its leading part. Positivity of \(A\) and Cauchy--Schwarz for
its form give the complete energy error
\[
\begin{split}
|w^t\mathcal Nw-\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)|
&\le\kappa\chi_E(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w)\\
&\quad+2\cdot10^7\kappa\xi^3\|w\|_2
 \sqrt{\mathcal J_\xi(w)+\chi_E(\xi)\mathcal A_\xi(w)}\\
&\quad+10^{14}\kappa\xi^6\|w\|_2^2.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.5}
\]
The cross term is bounded by
\(2\sqrt{\mathfrak q_A[Q_\psi F_w\psi]\mathfrak q_A[s_w]}\);
(18.4) bounds its first factor and (16.10) its second.
This proves (18.5) for every weight, including any dependence
of the weight on the box and coupling.

## 18.2. Uniform relative errors and every electric-state quotient

Keep \(d_0=196/13689\) and \(\rho_{\rm mix}\) from (17.9).
Define the following explicit functions of the original \(\xi\):
\[
\begin{split}
r(\xi)&=\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)/b_0,\qquad
t_C(\xi)=6\cdot10^6\sqrt{2/d_0}\,\xi,\\
t_N(\xi)&=10^7\sqrt{2/d_0}\,\xi,\\
\beta_C(\xi)&=r(\xi)+2t_C(\xi)\sqrt{1+r(\xi)}+t_C(\xi)^2,\\
\beta_N(\xi)&=\frac{\chi_E(\xi)}{b_0}
 +2t_N(\xi)\sqrt{q_*+\frac{\chi_E(\xi)}{b_0}}+t_N(\xi)^2.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.6}
\]
By (17.6) and (17.11),
\(\|w\|_2\le\sqrt{2/d_0}\xi^{-2}\sqrt{\mathcal H_\xi(w)}\)
and \(\mathcal A_\xi(w)\le\mathcal H_\xi(w)/b_0\).
Substitution into every term of (17.12) and (18.5), followed by
the two inequalities in (18.2), proves
\[
\begin{split}
|w^tCw-\mathcal H_\xi(w)|
 &\le\beta_C(\xi)\mathcal H_\xi(w),\\
|w^t\mathcal Nw-\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)|
 &\le\kappa\beta_N(\xi)\mathcal H_\xi(w).
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.7}
\]
For example the covariance cross term, divided by
\(\mathcal H_\xi(w)\), is at most
\(12\cdot10^6\sqrt{2/d_0}\xi\sqrt{1+r}\), exactly the
middle term of \(\beta_C\). The energy calculation has the
same retained two factors and yields its displayed \(\beta_N\).
All these functions tend to zero as \(\xi\downarrow0\):
\(\rho_{\rm mix}\) is \(\xi\) times a fixed cubic in
\(\log(1/\xi)\), and all other factors are displayed.

On the explicit nonempty interval \(0<\xi\le10^{-24}\), set
\(x_0=10^{-24}\) only for recording numerical bounds. Equation
(17.13), \(2/d_0=13689/98<144\), and rational comparisons give
\[
\begin{split}
\beta_C(\xi)&<B_C:={10^{-11}\over b_0}
 +4(72\cdot10^6x_0)+(72\cdot10^6x_0)^2<10^{-8},\\
\beta_N(\xi)&<B_N:={8000000x_0\over b_0}
 +6(120\cdot10^6x_0)+(120\cdot10^6x_0)^2<2\cdot10^{-15}.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.8}
\]
Here \(1+10^{-11}/b_0<4\) and
\(q_*+8000000x_0/b_0<9\) justify respectively the square-root
bounds two and three used above. The polynomial monotonicity
proved in Section17.3 makes these bounds valid on the whole
interval, not just at its upper endpoint. Define
\[
\delta(\xi)=\frac{\beta_N(\xi)+q_*\beta_C(\xi)}{1-\beta_C(\xi)}.
\]
Its denominator is positive and
\(\delta(\xi)<(B_N+q_*B_C)/(1-B_C)<10^{-7}\).
For every nonzero original weight, (17.14) permits division
by the actual norm. Subtract the two quotients with their
denominators retained:
\[
\begin{split}
{w^t\mathcal Nw\over w^tCw}
 -{\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)\over\mathcal H_\xi(w)}
&={w^t\mathcal Nw-\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)\over w^tCw}\\
&\quad-{\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)\over\mathcal H_\xi(w)}
 {w^tCw-\mathcal H_\xi(w)\over w^tCw}.
\end{split}
\]
Since \(w^tCw\ge(1-\beta_C)\mathcal H_\xi(w)\), this proves
\[
\boxed{\quad
\left|{w^t\mathcal Nw\over w^tCw}
       -{\kappa\mathcal J_\xi(w)\over\mathcal H_\xi(w)}\right|
 \le\kappa\delta(\xi),\quad
0<\xi\le10^{-24},\quad w\ne0.\quad}                         \tag{18.9}
\]
The bound is uniform in every original box and every such
weight. It controls all quotients, not only the minimum or
the incidence kernel. In particular they all lie between
\(\kappa(3-\delta(\xi))\) and \(\kappa(q_*+\delta(\xi))\).
The independent stronger physical lower bound
\(3\kappa(1-512\xi/3)\) from (15.13) still applies.

For a precise record of the interpolation, put
\[
\eta_\xi(w)={b_0\xi^4\|c\|_2^2\over\mathcal H_\xi(w)}.
\]
Then \(0\le\eta_\xi(w)\le1\), and the coefficient quotient
satisfies the exact identity
\[
\frac{\mathcal J_\xi(w)}{\mathcal H_\xi(w)}
 =3+\frac{87}{49}\eta_\xi(w).                                \tag{18.10}
\]
This records both contributions with their original powers
of coupling. It is not a change of state or its norm.

## 18.3. Exact compression, inverse and retained leakage

Let \(\mathcal H_{\rm phys,\mathbb R}\) be the real-valued
part of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space. The real operator
\(A\) preserves it. Set
\(\mathscr S_\xi=\operatorname{Ran}V_\xi\subset
 \mathcal H_{\rm phys,\mathbb R}\cap\psi^\perp\), where
\(V_\xi w=v_w\). On the interval above, (17.14) proves
\(\dim\mathscr S_\xi=N\). Every vector of this space is
smooth. The adjoint and the orthogonal projection are
\[
\begin{split}
V_\xi^*f&=(\langle v_e,f\rangle)_e,\qquad V_\xi^*V_\xi=C,\\
P_{\mathscr S_\xi}&=V_\xi C^{-1}V_\xi^*.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.11}
\]
The last operator is self-adjoint because \(C\) is positive
and symmetric. Its square is itself by \(V_\xi^*V_\xi=C\).
Its range is contained in \(\mathscr S_\xi\), and it fixes
\(V_\xi w\) for every \(w\); thus it is the stated projection.
The inverse of \(V_\xi\) on its image is \(C^{-1}V_\xi^*\),
which is the exact formula (17.15).

Define the self-adjoint finite-dimensional compression
\(R_\xi=P_{\mathscr S_\xi}A|_{\mathscr S_\xi}\). For
\(u,v\in\mathscr S_\xi\),
\(\langle u,R_\xi v\rangle=\langle u,Av\rangle
=\langle Au,v\rangle\). Its coordinate intertwiner and its
full uncompressed action are exactly
\[
\begin{split}
R_\xi V_\xi&=V_\xi C^{-1}\mathcal N,\\
AV_\xi&=V_\xi C^{-1}\mathcal N+\mathcal L_\xi,\qquad
\mathcal L_\xi:=(I-P_{\mathscr S_\xi})AV_\xi,\\
V_\xi^*\mathcal L_\xi&=0.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.12}
\]
These follow by inserting (18.11) and
\(V_\xi^*AV_\xi=\mathcal N\). The domain of
\(\mathcal L_\xi\) is the entire finite edge space; its
codomain is \(\mathscr S_\xi^\perp\cap
\mathcal H_{\rm phys,\mathbb R}\cap\psi^\perp\).
Thus \(C^{-1}\mathcal N\) is self-adjoint in the exact
inner product \(\langle w,z\rangle_C=w^tCz\). This records
its metric rather than replacing it by the Euclidean one.
The map \(V_\xi\) is an isometry from this metric space
onto \(\mathscr S_\xi\). Its Rayleigh quotient is exactly
the first quotient in (18.9). No vanishing of
\(\mathcal L_\xi\), or invariance of the state image under
\(A\), is used or asserted.

## 18.4. Ordered Ritz values and the exact top coefficient eigenspace

Let \(B_0\) be the diagonal coefficient matrix with entries
one on faces and \(b_0\) on pairs, and let \(B_1\) have
entries three on faces and \(1/26\) on pairs. On the original
edge space define
\[
\mathsf H_\xi=\mathsf T_\xi^tB_0\mathsf T_\xi,\qquad
\mathsf J_\xi=\mathsf T_\xi^tB_1\mathsf T_\xi,
\qquad K^{\rm coeff}_\xi=\mathsf H_\xi^{-1}\mathsf J_\xi.
                                                               \tag{18.13}
\]
Their quadratic forms are respectively \(\mathcal H_\xi\)
and \(\mathcal J_\xi\), and (17.6) proves the inverse exists.
The operator \(K^{\rm coeff}_\xi\) is self-adjoint in the
positive metric \(\mathsf H_\xi\). Let its ordered eigenvalues
be \(\mu_1\le\cdots\le\mu_N\), retaining their dependence
on \(L,\xi\), and let \(\lambda_1\le\cdots\le\lambda_N\)
be those of \(R_\xi\), with physical energy units retained.

Here is the full variational comparison argument. For any
self-adjoint operator \(B\) in a finite-dimensional positive
inner product \(g\), take a \(g\)-orthonormal eigenbasis with
ordered eigenvalues \(\nu_i\). A \(j\)-dimensional subspace
intersects the \(g\)-orthogonal complement of the first
\(j-1\) eigenvectors in a nonzero vector: the projection
onto their span has rank at most \(j-1\). Such a vector has
Rayleigh quotient at least \(\nu_j\), by its eigenbasis
expansion. The span of the first \(j\) eigenvectors has
maximum quotient exactly \(\nu_j\). Hence
\[
\nu_j=\min_{\substack{W\text{ linear}\\\dim W=j}}
       \ \max_{0\ne w\in W}\frac{g(w,Bw)}{g(w,w)}.
                                                               \tag{18.14}
\]
The eigenbasis used to prove this identity does not change
the original physical vectors or either retained Gram matrix.
Both problems in (18.13) and (18.12) use precisely the same
collection of linear subspaces of the raw edge space. Apply
(18.9) to every nonzero vector of every one of those subspaces,
then take the maximum and minimum in (18.14). This proves
\[
\boxed{\quad
|\lambda_j/\kappa-\mu_j|\le\delta(\xi)
\quad(1\le j\le N),\qquad 3\le\mu_j\le\frac{234}{49}.
\quad}                                                       \tag{18.15}
\]
No volume-dependent matrix perturbation constant enters.

The top eigenspace of the coefficient problem is computable
exactly, without solving a large characteristic polynomial:
\[
q_*\mathsf H_\xi-\mathsf J_\xi
 =\frac{87}{49}\frac{\xi^2}{16}\mathsf I^t\mathsf I,
\qquad
\ker(K^{\rm coeff}_\xi-q_*I)=\ker\mathsf I .                 \tag{18.16}
\]
The first identity follows by retaining both diagonal blocks
in (18.13); the pair block vanishes because \(q_*b_0=1/26\).
Its right side is positive, with zero quadratic form exactly
when \(\mathsf Iw=0\). Invertibility of \(\mathsf H_\xi\)
then proves the stated equality of kernels.

The exact original-box incidence calculation in the parent,
*Electric covariance and unsigned incidence*, Section3,
equations(3.2)--(3.9), gives
\(\dim\ker\mathsf I=3m(m+1)=N-M\), \(m=2L\).
For explicitness, its coordinate proof writes
\(w_i(n)=(-1)^{n_1+n_2+n_3}a_i(n)\) and turns the kernel
equations into \(D_ja_i+D_ia_j=0\). Commuting differences in
three distinct directions gives \(D_kD_ja_i=0\). The complete
inverse parameters are the longitudinal boundary values
\(f_i(n_i)\) and anchored potentials
\(\varphi_{ij}(x,y)=\sum_{r=-L}^{x-1}u_{ij}(r,y)\), where
\(u_{ij}(x,y)=a_i(x\mathbf e_i+y\mathbf e_j-L\mathbf e_k)-f_i(x)\).
They obey \(\varphi_{ij}(-L,y)=\varphi_{ij}(x,-L)=0\), and
reconstruct
\[
a_i(n)=f_i(n_i)+\sum_{j>i}D_i\varphi_{ij}(n_i,n_j)
                    -\sum_{j<i}D_i\varphi_{ji}(n_j,n_i).
\]
The vanishing transverse mixed difference proves the additive
decomposition giving these parameters; summing
\(D_ju_{ij}+D_iu_{ji}=0\) proves both reconstructed cross
derivatives. The boundary values and finite sums fix the inverse
uniquely. There are \(3m\) longitudinal and \(3m^2\) anchored
potential entries, on the original edge and vertex domains.
Thus (18.16), including multiplicities, gives
\[
\begin{split}
\mu_{M+1}=\cdots=\mu_N&=\frac{234}{49},\qquad
\mu_j<\frac{234}{49}\quad(1\le j\le M),\\
\left|\lambda_j-\frac{234}{49}\kappa\right|
 &\le\kappa\delta(\xi)\quad(M+1\le j\le N).
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.17}
\]
No uniform separation of \(\mu_M\) from \(q_*\) is asserted.
The last \(N-M\) Ritz values need not be exactly equal; the
comparison preserves the actual mixed energy and covariance.

## 18.5. Consequence for the true physical excitation eigenvalues

The gauge-invariant restriction of \(A\) has compact resolvent
because its gauge projection commutes with the full resolvent;
the restriction is a compression of a compact operator. Remove
its simple vacuum. The remaining physical space is infinite
dimensional: characters of every integer and half-integer spin
of a fixed face holonomy are gauge invariant, and are linearly
independent by integration in one face link. Removing one
dimension does not change that fact. Let
\(\epsilon_1\le\epsilon_2\le\cdots\) be the true excitation
eigenvalues there, counted with multiplicity.

The eigenbasis proof of (18.14) applies also to this positive
compact-resolvent operator: the first \(j\) eigenvectors give
the upper variational inequality, and expansion of the
nonzero intersection with their first \(j-1\) orthogonal
complement gives the lower one. This uses the form domain
for the nonnegative convergent spectral sum. Restricting the
admissible \(j\)-dimensional spaces to
\(\mathscr S_\xi\subset\operatorname{Dom}A\) therefore gives
\[
\begin{split}
3\kappa(1-512\xi/3)&\le\epsilon_j\le\lambda_j
 \le\kappa\bigl(\mu_j+\delta(\xi)\bigr)\quad(1\le j\le N),\\
\#\{j:\epsilon_j\le\kappa(q_*+\delta(\xi))\}&\ge N.
\end{split}                                                   \tag{18.18}
\]
The lower bound is the independent physical gap proof (15.13).
The upper inequalities and count are for the original interacting
operator, not the free coefficient operator. They do not transfer
the exact coefficient multiplicity in (18.17) into a physical
eigenvalue multiplicity. Equation (18.12) gives the exact map
and retained leakage underlying that distinction. All energies
are measured from the actual \(\mathcal E\); no level below
that spectral minimum has been introduced.

For the original nonnegative native weights in (1.4), the
sharper targeted bounds of Section14 remain in force. The
present result additionally controls every mixed signed weight
and the full ordered electric-state compression. It leaves
\(a>0\), \(\kappa=2g_{\rm YM}^2/a\),
\(\xi=1/(4g_{\rm YM}^4)\), and the geometric input (1.3)
unchanged. No spatial continuum limit or Millennium conclusion
is inferred from this finite-regulator strong-coupling result.

## 18.6. Precise literature dependency and an attainment counterexample

The canonical corpus routes the variational method to Mathieu
Lewin, *Spectral Theory and Quantum Mechanics*, Universitext,
Springer2024, DOI[10.1007/978-3-031-66878-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66878-4),
Section5.6.1, printed pages201--204. Equations(5.42) and(5.44)
are the min--max value and restriction inequality used here;
(18.14) and(18.18) provide their proofs in the exact present
spaces. Two details in that edition must not be imported as
extra mathematical claims.

First, the sentence on page202 asserting that the minimizing
subspaces are exactly eigenvector-generated low-energy spaces,
and the concluding necessity argument on page204, fail for
the following explicit example. On \(\mathbb R^3\) with its
Euclidean inner product take
\[
B=\operatorname{diag}(0,1,2),\qquad
W=\operatorname{span}(e_2,e_1+e_3).
\]
For all real \(s,t\),
\[
\langle se_2+t(e_1+e_3),B[se_2+t(e_1+e_3)]\rangle
 =s^2+2t^2=\|se_2+t(e_1+e_3)\|^2.                           \tag{18.19}
\]
Every nonzero vector of \(W\) has quotient one, the second
eigenvalue of \(B\). The dimension-intersection proof of
(18.14) proves this is the minimizing value. Yet \(W\) is
not contained in \(\operatorname{span}(e_1,e_2)\), and
\(W\cap\operatorname{span}(e_3)=\{0\}\). Failure of
containment does not imply the nonzero intersection used in
the source's necessity argument. The min--max value itself
is unaffected; only that characterization of all attaining
spaces is refuted.

Second, the matrix following (5.44) represents the stated
ordinary eigenvalues with an orthonormal basis. For a general
basis \(v_i\), the exact coordinate problem is
\(\mathcal Nw=\lambda Cw\), with both Gram matrices retained,
as proved in (18.11)--(18.12). Already on \(\mathbb R\), the
identity operator and basis vector \(v_1=2\) give
\(\mathcal N=(4)\), \(C=(4)\), and eigenvalue one, not four.
These independent finite-dimensional checks explain exactly
which source assertions are used and which are corrected.
They assert nothing about unread editions or other parts of
the book. No protected bulk text is reproduced in this note.

# 19. Original negative period value, collapse, and negative magnetic eigenvalues

This section corrects the previous Section19: its auxiliary two-coordinate
form was not the actual Euclidean metric, and its negative-direction witness
was false. Neither inference may be used to exclude the original negative
period value. The following are calculations in the retained period matrix
and the existing full link Hilbert space.

## 19.1. The original expression and the complete metric map

Retain the expression, including its denominator and its domain,
\[
\Delta_{\tau_T,\beta_T,\mu_T}:=
\operatorname{Im}\tau_T\left(\operatorname{Im}\beta_T-
\frac{6(\operatorname{Im}\mu_T)^2}{\operatorname{Im}\tau_T}\right),
\qquad \operatorname{Im}\tau_T\ne0.
                                                               \tag{19.1}
\]
Use the original dictionary
\(L_T=\operatorname{Im}\tau_T\), \(q_T=-\operatorname{Im}\beta_T\),
\(m_T=\operatorname{Im}\mu_T\), \(D=L_Tq_T+6m_T^2\).
Substitution into the displayed expression, without replacing it by a
different condition, gives the exact relation
\[
\Delta_{\tau_T,\beta_T,\mu_T}=-D.
                                                               \tag{19.2}
\]
In particular, the original domain \(D>0\) already has
\(\Delta_{\tau_T,\beta_T,\mu_T}<0\). A claim that this sign alone lies
outside the existing construction is false.

Write \(M_{\rm cov}\in\mathbb N_{>0}\) for the cover degree parameter called
\(M\) in the parent cusp note, to retain its identity without confusing it
with this note's number of faces. Keep all real and imaginary entries:
\[
\begin{aligned}
A_T&=\begin{pmatrix}6\operatorname{Re}\mu_T&\operatorname{Re}\tau_T\\
 \operatorname{Re}\beta_T&\operatorname{Re}\mu_T\end{pmatrix},
&
B_T&=\begin{pmatrix}6m_T&L_T\\-q_T&m_T\end{pmatrix},\\
P_{M_{\rm cov}}&=
\begin{pmatrix}
6\operatorname{Re}\mu_T&\operatorname{Re}\tau_T&M_{\rm cov}&0\\
6m_T&L_T&0&0\\
\operatorname{Re}\beta_T&\operatorname{Re}\mu_T&0&M_{\rm cov}\\
-q_T&m_T&0&0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.3}
\]
The original physical coordinate order is
\[
(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(\operatorname{Re}z_1,\operatorname{Im}z_1,
\operatorname{Re}z_2,\operatorname{Im}z_2).
\]
The recorded permutation \(R(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(x_1,x_3,x_2,x_4)\)
has \(R^tR=I\), \(\det R=-1\), and
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q:=RP_{M_{\rm cov}}&=\begin{pmatrix}A_T&M_{\rm cov}I_2\\B_T&0\end{pmatrix},\\
Q^{-1}&=\begin{pmatrix}0&B_T^{-1}\\
 M_{\rm cov}^{-1}I_2&-M_{\rm cov}^{-1}A_TB_T^{-1}\end{pmatrix},
&
B_T^{-1}&=\frac1D\begin{pmatrix}m_T&-L_T\\q_T&6m_T\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.4}
\]
Both products in (19.4) are the identity: their off-diagonal blocks
are respectively \(-A_TB_T^{-1}+A_TB_T^{-1}\) and
\(M_{\rm cov}^{-1}A_T-M_{\rm cov}^{-1}A_T\), and their diagonal blocks
are \(I_2\). This proves the inverse for either sign of \(D\ne0\).

For \(G=P_{M_{\rm cov}}^tP_{M_{\rm cov}}\) the exact quadratic form is
\[
\begin{aligned}
G&=\begin{pmatrix}
 A_T^tA_T+B_T^tB_T&M_{\rm cov}A_T^t\\
 M_{\rm cov}A_T&M_{\rm cov}^2I_2
\end{pmatrix},\\
(r,z)^tG(r,z)&=\lvert A_Tr+M_{\rm cov}z\rvert^2+\lvert B_Tr\rvert^2,\\
\det P_{M_{\rm cov}}&=-M_{\rm cov}^2D,\qquad
\det G=M_{\rm cov}^4D^2,\qquad
\sqrt{\det G}=M_{\rm cov}^2|D|.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.5}
\]
Here \(r,z\in\mathbb R^2\). Zero quadratic value forces \(B_Tr=0\),
then \(r=0\) by (19.4), then \(z=0\). Thus \(G\) is positive definite
for both signs of \(D\). To compute the determinant of \(Q\), exchange
its two column blocks. This uses four transpositions and gives the block
triangular matrix with diagonal blocks \(M_{\rm cov}I_2,B_T\).
Multiplication by \(R\) gives the sign in (19.5).

The map
\(\phi:[y]\mapsto[P_{M_{\rm cov}}y]\) from
\(\mathbb R^4/\mathbb Z^4\) to
\(\mathbb R^4/P_{M_{\rm cov}}\mathbb Z^4\) is a bijection with inverse
\([x]\mapsto[P_{M_{\rm cov}}^{-1}x]\). Its lift has zero kernel; its
composition with the target quotient has kernel \(\mathbb Z^4\).
Equation (19.5) proves that \(\phi\) is an isometry from the first torus
with metric \(G\) to the second with the Euclidean metric.
Its oriented Jacobian is \(-M_{\rm cov}^2D\); its density Jacobian
is \(M_{\rm cov}^2|D|\). These are two explicitly related quantities,
not an argument for discarding the sign. On the original \(D>0\)
domain the latter is exactly the parent's \(M_{\rm cov}^2D\).

## 19.2. Exact relation to the auxiliary form and the collapsing direction

The form introduced in the previous version of this section was
\[
G_\eta=
\begin{pmatrix}
2\operatorname{Im}\tau_T&2\operatorname{Im}\mu_T\\
2\operatorname{Im}\mu_T&\operatorname{Im}\beta_T/3
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}2L_T&2m_T\\2m_T&-q_T/3\end{pmatrix}.
                                                               \tag{19.6}
\]
Its relation to the imaginary period block is an invertible linear
coordinate map, not an identification of their metrics:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathfrak F:
\left\{\begin{pmatrix}6m&L\\-q&m\end{pmatrix}:L,m,q\in\mathbb R\right\}
 &\longrightarrow \operatorname{Sym}_2(\mathbb R),\\
B&\longmapsto
 \begin{pmatrix}2B_{12}&B_{11}/3\\B_{11}/3&B_{21}/3\end{pmatrix},\\
\mathfrak F^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}u&v\\v&w\end{pmatrix}
 &=\begin{pmatrix}3v&u/2\\3w&v/2\end{pmatrix},\qquad
\det G_\eta=-\frac23D=\frac23\Delta_{\tau_T,\beta_T,\mu_T}.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.7}
\]
Entry-by-entry composition proves both inverse identities. The kernel is
zero and every fibre is a singleton. This map retains all three imaginary
parameters; it does not encode \(A_T\) or \(M_{\rm cov}\).

On the original \(D>0\) domain, the following two vectors give the
signature without a guessed sign-reversal argument:
\[
(1,0)G_\eta(1,0)^t=2L_T,\qquad
(-m_T/L_T,1)G_\eta(-m_T/L_T,1)^t=-\frac{D}{3L_T}.
                                                               \tag{19.8}
\]
They have opposite signs for every \(L_T\ne0\).
Nevertheless the actual metric in (19.5) is positive definite.
An indefinite nondegenerate form also has an absolute volume density
\(\sqrt{|\det G_\eta|}\); the former claim that indefiniteness prevents
any positive volume density was false.

There is an explicit collapse at \(D=0\), rather than a new region added
to avoid it. In the retained coefficient coordinates put
\[
k_T=(L_T,-6m_T)^t,\qquad
v_T=(k_T,-M_{\rm cov}^{-1}A_Tk_T)^t.
\]
Direct multiplication, with all parameters unchanged, gives
\[
B_Tk_T=(0,-D)^t,\qquad
Qv_T=(0,0,0,-D)^t,\qquad
v_T^tGv_T=D^2.
                                                               \tag{19.9}
\]
At \(D=0\), \(L_T\ne0\) makes \(B_T\) rank one; (19.4)'s inverse
ceases to exist. The kernel of \(P_{M_{\rm cov}}\) is exactly
\(\mathbb R v_T\): solve \(B_Tr=0\), then
\(z=-M_{\rm cov}^{-1}A_Tr\). Thus the extended real matrix has rank three.
For fixed \(M_{\rm cov}\) and bounded period parameters approaching that locus with
\(|L_T|\ge \ell>0\), the least metric eigenvalue satisfies
\[
0\le\lambda_{\min}(G)\le
\frac{D^2}{\lvert k_T\rvert^2+
 M_{\rm cov}^{-2}\lvert A_Tk_T\rvert^2}\le\frac{D^2}{\ell^2}.
                                                               \tag{19.10}
\]
The variational inequality follows by testing the unit direction
\(v_T/|v_T|\); it is not a change of the original period parameters.
The oriented determinant and density in (19.5) both approach zero.
This is a statement about the displayed period family; no assertion
that every such coefficient path occurs in a completed S6 threefold
has been inserted.

For completeness, the same collapse has a calculated classical action.
The full inverse metric is obtained by multiplying \(Q^{-1}Q^{-t}\).
Its leading two-by-two block is \(B_T^{-1}B_T^{-t}\); its determinant
is \(D^{-2}\). The induced two-form Gram entry is therefore
\(\mathcal K_{12,12}=D^{-2}\).
Pullback of the original connection preserves every commutator:
\(\widetilde F_{ij}=\sum_{\alpha,\beta}P_{\alpha i}P_{\beta j}
F_{\alpha\beta}\circ P\), by the chain rule and bilinearity.
Consequently, for \(\widetilde F_{12}=2\pi H_c\), other components zero,
\(c(H_c,H_c)=-\operatorname{tr}(H_c^2)/2=1\), the unchanged action is
\[
S=\frac{M_{\rm cov}^2|D|}{2g_{\rm YM}^2}
 (2\pi)^2D^{-2}
 =\frac{2\pi^2M_{\rm cov}^2}{g_{\rm YM}^2|D|}.
                                                               \tag{19.11}
\]
For fixed \(M_{\rm cov},g_{\rm YM}>0\) it diverges as \(D\to0\).
The absolute Jacobian here is required by the proved Euclidean pullback,
not an unexplained deletion of an unfavorable sign. On \(D>0\) this
is exactly the original action. Collapse and this action divergence
are not yet a quantum spectral limit.

## 19.3. The sign map inside the original magnetic operator

Return to the full spatial box and its original \(a,g_{\rm YM}>0\).
The finite, nonwrapping patch has
\(h_1(n)=e^{-\theta n_2H_c}\), \(h_2(n)=h_3(n)=I\),
\(H_c=i\sigma_3=-2T_3\), \(\theta=2\pi a^2/D\).
The parent derivation retains
\[
\begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\end{pmatrix}
=\frac1D\begin{pmatrix}m_T&-L_T\\q_T&6m_T\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}y_1\\y_2\end{pmatrix},\quad
du_1\wedge du_2=D^{-1}dy_1\wedge dy_2,
                                                               \tag{19.12}
\]
and the original connection
\[
\begin{aligned}
A_{\rm orig}&=\frac{2\pi H_c}{D^2}
(m_Ty_1-L_Ty_2)(q_Tdy_1+6m_Tdy_2),\\
f(y)&=\frac{2\pi}{D^2}
\left(\frac{m_Tq_T}{2}y_1^2-L_Tq_Ty_1y_2-3m_TL_Ty_2^2\right),\\
A_{\rm orig}&=(2\pi/D)H_cy_1dy_2+H_cdf.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.13}
\]
For the \(dy_1\) component both sides equal
\(2\pi H_c(m_Tq_Ty_1-L_Tq_Ty_2)/D^2\).
For the \(dy_2\) component, the right side's coefficient is
\(2\pi H_c[(D-L_Tq_T)y_1-6m_TL_Ty_2]/D^2\), equal to the left
because \(D-L_Tq_T=6m_T^2\).
The two gauge maps \(e^{-H_cf(y)}\) and
\(e^{-(2\pi/D)H_cy_1y_2}\) produce
\(-(2\pi/D)H_cy_2dy_1\). Integrating with the parent's
inverse-parallel-transport convention gives the stated links.
This proves the local dictionary for either sign of \(D\ne0\);
it does not remove periodic transition edges or assert a completed
threefold construction.

Define \(T_hF(U)=F((h_e^{-1}U_e)_e)\) and retain the original gauge
projection \(\Pi\). Conjugation by a vertex gauge map conjugates \(h_e\)
at its source vertex. Exactly one possibly nonidentity \(h_e\) has
any given source. The independent vertex integrals therefore give,
on invariant inputs,
\[
\Pi T_h\Pi=K_\theta\Pi,\qquad
K_\theta=\prod_{e=(n,1)}C_{e,\theta n_2},\qquad
C_{e,s}F(U)=\int F(\ldots,g e^{sH_c}g^{-1}U_e,\ldots)\,dg.
                                                               \tag{19.14}
\]
Each factor is a Haar average of unitary link translations, hence a
contraction and a map preserving pointwise nonnegative functions.
The matrix \(J=i\sigma_1\) obeys \(JH_cJ^{-1}=-H_c\).
Replacing \(g\) by \(gJ\) proves \(C_{e,-s}=C_{e,s}=C_{e,s}^*\).
Thus, exactly at fixed \(a,L,g_{\rm YM}\),
\[
K_{-\theta}=K_\theta,\qquad
K_{\theta+2\pi}=K_\theta,\qquad K_{2\pi k}=I\quad(k\in\mathbb Z).
                                                               \tag{19.15}
\]
The periodic identities use the original integer \(n_2\) and
\(e^{2\pi H_c}=I\), without changing the angle variable.
For the actual vacuum define
\(c_\theta=\langle\psi,K_\theta\psi\rangle\),
\(\chi_\theta=(K_\theta-c_\theta)\psi\),
\(d_\theta=\|\chi_\theta\|^2\), and
\(n_\theta=\langle K_\theta\psi,(H-\mathcal E)K_\theta\psi\rangle\).
All four are identical at \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\).
In particular the map \(D\mapsto K_{2\pi a^2/D}\) loses the sign of \(D\).
At \(D=a^2/k\), \(k\ne0\), \(\chi_\theta=0\) exactly.
It is then a zero vector, and its Rayleigh quotient is undefined;
no zero-energy eigenstate is manufactured by dividing by its norm.
These identities neither identify different \(|D|\) nor control a
spatial continuum limit.

## 19.4. A negative eigenvalue in the existing gauge-invariant space

Preservation of pointwise nonnegative functions does not imply
\(\langle F,K_\theta F\rangle\ge0\). Here is an explicit violation of
that proposed inference, within the existing operator.

Use the spin-one representation \(\rho_1=\operatorname{Sym}^2\mathbb C^2\).
In its three weight coordinates,
\(\rho_1(e^{sH_c})\) has diagonal entries \(e^{2is},1,e^{-2is}\).
In the basis \(v_0=e_+\otimes e_+\),
\(v_1=e_+\otimes e_-+e_-\otimes e_+\),
\(v_2=e_-\otimes e_-\), use the complexified generators
\(E=iT_1-T_2\), \(F=iT_1+T_2\), acting on both tensor factors.
Their full actions are
\[
Ev_0=0,\quad Ev_1=2v_0,\quad Ev_2=v_1,\qquad
Fv_0=v_1,\quad Fv_1=2v_2,\quad Fv_2=0.
\]
This representation is irreducible: the diagonal circle splits it into
three distinct weights, and these generators connect adjacent weights.
An
invariant subspace for the unitary group has an invariant orthogonal
complement and hence a projection commuting with that circle; it is
a sum of weight spaces. The connecting generators force either none
or all three of them.

Averaging \(\rho_1(g e^{sH_c}g^{-1})\) commutes with the representation,
so its scalar is fixed by its trace:
\[
c_1(s)=\frac{e^{2is}+1+e^{-2is}}3
       =\frac{1+2\cos(2s)}3.
\]
Choose \(\theta_*=\arccos(1/4)\in(0,\pi)\). Then, exactly,
\[
\cos(2\theta_*)=-\frac78,\qquad
c_1(\theta_*)=-\frac14,\qquad
e^{\theta_*H_c}=\frac14 I+\frac{\sqrt{15}}4H_c,\qquad
D_*=\frac{2\pi a^2}{\theta_*}>0.
                                                               \tag{19.16}
\]
The factor \(1/3\) comes from the trace on the existing
three-dimensional representation, not from a substituted model.

Let \(\mathcal P_0\) consist of the 12-faces based at
\(n=(r,0,t)\), \(-L\le r<L\), \(-L\le t\le L\). Its cardinality is
\(d_L=(2L)(2L+1)\). For each such face let \(U_p\) be its full ordered
holonomy from (1.1) and put
\[
F_p(U)=\operatorname{tr}\rho_1(U_p)=W_p(U)^2-1.
                                                               \tag{19.17}
\]
To prove the last equality, diagonalize an arbitrary \(SU(2)\) matrix
with eigenvalues \(e^{is},e^{-is}\). Its fundamental trace squared
minus one is \(e^{2is}+1+e^{-2is}\), the symmetric-square trace.
Both sides are conjugation invariant, so the equality holds on all
\(SU(2)\). Gauge transformations conjugate \(U_p\) at its base vertex;
therefore \(F_p\) is gauge invariant and smooth. It is not zero:
\(F_p(I,\ldots,I)=3\).

The two direction-one edges of \(p\) have heights \(n_2=0,1\).
Their class averages act by \(c_1(0)=1,c_1(\theta)\); inverse traversal
has the dual representation, with the same scalar because \(c_1\) is
real and even. All other translated edges carry the trivial
representation in \(F_p\). Thus
\[
K_{\theta_*}F_p=-\tfrac14 F_p,\qquad
\langle F_p,F_q\rangle_{L^2(dU)}=\delta_{pq}.
                                                               \tag{19.18}
\]
Here is the norm proof, retaining the coordinate metric and not assuming
independence of overlapping faces. The displayed symmetric-tensor basis
has Gram matrix \(S=\operatorname{diag}(1,2,1)\); it is not rescaled.
Write \(h_0=1,h_1=2,h_2=1\). Its representation matrices obey
\(\rho(U)^*S\rho(U)=S\), so
\(\rho(U)^{-1}=S^{-1}\rho(U)^*S\).
The averaging map \(X\mapsto\int\rho(U)X\rho(U)^{-1}dU\) commutes
with the irreducible representation and preserves the trace. Thus
it equals \(\operatorname{tr}(X)I/3\).
Applying this to each matrix unit and retaining \(S\) gives
\[
\int\overline{\rho_{ij}(U)}\rho_{kl}(U)dU
=\frac{h_j}{3h_i}\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}.
\]
For the diagonal entries in the trace, \(j=i\) and \(l=k\), so the
retained metric factor is one. Summing those entries gives
\(\int|\operatorname{tr}\rho(U)|^2dU=1\).
Integrate one edge of \(p\), holding the others fixed; its holonomy
is Haar distributed by left/right invariance and inversion invariance.
This proves the norm. For \(p\ne q\), choose an edge in \(p\setminus q\).
The average of its nontrivial representation matrix is zero, since
the representation has no invariant vector. The same single-edge
integral proves orthogonality, including adjacent faces.

The isometry
\[
\mathscr F:\mathbb C^{\mathcal P_0}\longrightarrow
L^2(dU)^{\rm gauge},\qquad w\longmapsto\sum_{p\in\mathcal P_0}w_pF_p
                                                               \tag{19.19}
\]
has zero kernel and inverse coordinates \(w_p=\langle F_p,\mathscr Fw\rangle\)
on its image. Its image projector is
\(P_{\mathscr F}f=\sum_pF_p\langle F_p,f\rangle\).
On this entire \(d_L\)-dimensional image,
\(K_{\theta_*}=-I/4\). Thus \(K_{\theta_*}\) is genuinely not a
positive-semidefinite operator on the physical gauge-invariant space.

Retain the actual interacting vacuum rather than replacing it by the
constant function. Put \(\alpha_p=\langle\psi,F_p\rangle\), real because
both functions are real. The exact vacuum-orthogonal subspace is
\(\mathscr F(\ker\alpha^t)\), of dimension at least \(d_L-1\).
For \(\alpha\ne0\), its coefficient projection is
\(I-\alpha\alpha^t/(\alpha^t\alpha)\); for \(\alpha=0\) it is \(I\).
Composition proves these projections, their images and their kernels.
Every state in this subspace retains eigenvalue \(-1/4\) for
\(K_{\theta_*}\). Already at \(L=2\) its dimension is at least nineteen,
so six linearly independent such vacuum-orthogonal physical states
exist without changing the Hilbert space or invoking an indefinite measure.

## 19.5. Exact full-Hamiltonian image, without a positivity shortcut

The operator just calculated is related to \(H\) by its actual action,
not by assuming that its eigenvalues are energies. On each of the four
edges of \(p\), \(-\Delta_e^T F_p=2F_p\), and it vanishes on the other
edges. To verify the constant directly in the original convention,
the preceding \(E,F\) actions give \(J_3=[E,F]=\operatorname{diag}(2,0,-2)\)
and
\[
-\sum_{a=1}^3\rho_{1*}(T_a)^2
=\tfrac12(EF+FE)+\tfrac14J_3^2
=\tfrac12\operatorname{diag}(2,4,2)
 +\tfrac14\operatorname{diag}(4,0,4)=2I_3.
\]
Here \(\rho_{1*}(T_1)=(E+F)/(2i)\),
\(\rho_{1*}(T_2)=(F-E)/2\), and
\(\rho_{1*}(T_3)=-iJ_3/2\), as follows already on the two original
tensor factors. Hence the full electric sum is \(8F_p\), with
\(T_a=-i\sigma_a/2\) unchanged.

Each \(F_p=W_p^2-1\) is even under the central sign change
\(U_e\mapsto-U_e\) on any single link. For every face \(r\), \(W_r\)
is odd under that change on any one of its four edges.
Consequently Haar invariance gives
\(\langle F_p,W_rF_q\rangle=0\) for all \(p,q\in\mathcal P_0\)
and every original face \(r\), even when supports intersect.
The full potential and every original face are retained in
\[
\begin{aligned}
H\mathscr Fw&=(8\kappa+2bM)\mathscr Fw
             -b\sum_{r\in\mathsf P_L}W_r\,\mathscr Fw,\\
\mathscr F^*H\mathscr F&=(8\kappa+2bM)I,\qquad
P_{\mathscr F}\left(\sum_rW_r\mathscr Fw\right)=0.
\end{aligned}                                                    \tag{19.20}
\]
This is a full state map and its explicit component outside the image,
not a dropped interaction or an eigenvector assertion for \(H\).
Its domain consists of the finite-dimensional smooth image of
\(\mathscr F\), contained in \(\operatorname{Dom}H\).

For every nonzero \(w\in\ker\alpha^t\) the corresponding actual
vacuum-orthogonal state's two quadratic expressions are therefore
\[
\frac{\langle\mathscr Fw,K_{\theta_*}\mathscr Fw\rangle}
     {\|\mathscr Fw\|^2}=-\frac14,\qquad
\frac{\langle\mathscr Fw,(H-\mathcal E)\mathscr Fw\rangle}
     {\|\mathscr Fw\|^2}=8\kappa+2bM-\mathcal E.
                                                               \tag{19.21}
\]
The trial function \(1\) has unit norm, electric energy zero and
\(\int W_r\,dU=0\), by the same single-edge nontrivial representation
integral. The variational definition gives \(\mathcal E\le2bM\),
so the latter expression is at least \(8\kappa\).
This calculation does not discard the negative eigenvalue:
it proves its exact relation to the original interacting energy,
including the omitted-from-compression component in (19.20).

The original signed electric states are also already included.
For \(V_\xi w=\sum_ew_ev_e\), linearity gives
\[
V_\xi(-w)=-V_\xi w,\qquad
(-w)^tC(-w)=w^tCw,\qquad
(-w)^t\mathcal N(-w)=w^t\mathcal Nw.
                                                               \tag{19.22}
\]
Here \(C,\mathcal N\) are matrices, not functions \(C(w),\mathcal N(w)\).
This corrects the old Section19 notation. Mixed signs need not cancel:
their exact full-coordinate estimate is (17.14), with its stated
finite-regulator interval. It does not decide the \(D\to0\) quantum
limit, a continuum gap, or a completed S6 identification. Equations
(19.9), (19.11), (19.18) and (19.20) provide the actual collapse,
action divergence, negative eigenvalue and interacting state map.
No replacement state space has been constructed to protect a conclusion.

## 19.6. Source identities and scope of the correction

The complete retained period matrix and full action map are in the
root manuscript *Retained cusp coordinates and nonlinear gauge-field
integration*, Section1, file
\texttt{retained\_cusp\_nonlinear\_bridge.md}, read directly.
The exact magnetic gauge maps, class convolution and vacuum definitions
are in *Magnetic continuation, Gauss projection, and the interacting
vacuum*, Sections1,2 and4, file
\texttt{magnetic\_translation\_true\_vacuum.md}, equations(1.1)--(1.4),
(2.1)--(2.4) and(4.1)--(4.5). They are local research sources, not
published literature or certified by another task's report.

For the finite-graph representation framework the human primary source is
John C. Baez, *Spin Network States in Gauge Theory*, Advances in
Mathematics117 (1996),253--272,
[doi:10.1006/aima.1996.0012](https://doi.org/10.1006/aima.1996.0012),
[arXiv:gr-qc/9411007v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9411007v1),
Section *Gauge Theory on a Graph*, retained TeX lines174--321.
His endpoint convention is carried to ours by \(A_e=U_e^{-1}\):
inversion preserves Haar and sends
\(A_e\mapsto g_tA_eg_s^{-1}\) to
\(U_e\mapsto g_sU_eg_t^{-1}\). This supplies the exact convention
map. The negative eigenvalue example, its multiplicity bound and
the full energy calculation above are explicitly proved here;
no novelty claim or attribution to a Jacobi/Fable theorem is made.

# 20. Finite-angle local states, uniform weighted errors, and the original product

All objects in this section remain in the full box of Section1 with its
actual unit vacuum \(\psi\). Write \(A=H-\mathcal E\).
The proof first calculates individual class translations and their weighted
sum, then gives the exact map and a quantitative remainder relating that sum
to the original product \(K_\theta\). The sum is not substituted for the
product. We retain every angle, every plaquette and the interaction
\(\xi=b/\kappa=1/(4g_{\rm YM}^4)\).

## 20.1. Exact all-angle multipliers, with the exceptional angles retained

Let \(s_e\in\mathbb R\) be a specified angle at each link and define
\[
t_e=1-\cos s_e,\qquad J_e=I-C_{e,s_e}.
\]
The original class average is (19.14), on the same full one-link space.
On spin \(j\), put \(n=2j\in\mathbb N_0\). Its exact coefficient is
\[
c_j(s)=\frac1{n+1}\sum_{r=0}^n e^{i(2r-n)s}.
\]
The terms pair under \(r\mapsto n-r\), so this coefficient is real.
It lies in \([-1,1]\) as an average of numbers of modulus one.
For every integer \(k\),
\[
|e^{iks}-1|\le |k|\,|e^{is}-1|,
\qquad 1-\cos(ks)\le k^2(1-\cos s).
\]
For \(k>0\), factor \(e^{iks}-1=(e^{is}-1)\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}e^{irs}\);
the triangle inequality proves the first inequality. Negative \(k\)
has the same modulus, and \(k=0\) is exact. Squaring and dividing by
two proves the second. The finite sums of \(r,r^2\), proved by
induction on \(n\), give
\[
\frac1{n+1}\sum_{r=0}^n(2r-n)^2
 =\frac{n(n+2)}3=\frac43j(j+1).
\]
Consequently, in the joint original Peter--Weyl coordinates,
\[
0\le J_e\le2I,\qquad
0\le1-c_j(s_e)\le\frac43t_e j(j+1),\qquad
\|J_eF\|\le\frac43t_e\|E_eF\|
\quad(F\in\operatorname{Dom}E_e).
                                                               \tag{20.1}
\]
The last statement follows by squaring the scalar multiplier inequality
and summing the full orthogonal expansion. No representation is discarded.
On the fundamental representation \(c_{1/2}(s_e)=\cos s_e\), so
\(J_e=t_e I\) there. At \(s_e\in2\pi\mathbb Z\), \(J_e=0\) on every
representation, not merely on the fundamental one. No quotient by \(t_e=0\)
is used. The negative coefficients of \(C_{e,s_e}\), including Section19's
example, remain present: (20.1) concerns \(I-C_{e,s_e}\).

## 20.2. A local first-order state with an angle-uniform remainder

For the original star \(S_e=\bigcup_{p\ni e}\partial p\), retain
\(r_e\le4\), \(m_{S_e}\le52\), \(q_{S_e}<39\).
Use the operators \(P_S,Q_S,K_S,B_S,R_S\) from Section2 and abbreviate
\(\eta=P_S\psi\), \(u=Q_S\psi\), \(S=S_e\).
They are in the same interacting Hilbert space, with
\(\|u\|\le q_S\xi\), and
\[
J_e\psi=bJ_eR_SW_S\eta+bJ_eR_SW_Su .
\]
This follows from (2.8), \(J_eP_S=0\), and commutation of \(J_e\)
with \(R_S\). On a face containing \(e\), \(W_p\eta\) has four
fundamental link labels, local electric energy \(3\), and
\(J_eW_p\eta=t_eW_p\eta\). For a face not containing \(e\) it is
constant at \(e\), and \(J_eW_p\eta=0\).
The exterior-resolvent intertwiner proved in Section4 therefore gives
the full identity
\[
\begin{aligned}
J_e\psi-\frac{\xi t_e}{3}W_e^\star\psi
={}&-\frac{\xi t_e}{3}W_e^\star
       (3\kappa+K_S)^{-1}K_S\eta\\
 &+bJ_eR_SW_Su-\frac{\xi t_e}{3}W_e^\star u .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.2}
\]
The joint multiplier bound (20.1) and (2.7) imply
\(\|J_eR_S\|\le4t_e/(3\kappa)\).
Since \(\|K_S\eta\|\le2bm_Sq_S\xi\), each of the three terms in
(20.2) is bounded explicitly. For \(0<\xi\le1/64\),
\[
\begin{aligned}
\left\|J_e\psi-\frac{\xi t_e}{3}W_e^\star\psi\right\|
&\le t_e\left[
 \frac{(8m_S+2r_e)q_S}{3}\xi^2+
 \frac{4r_em_Sq_S}{9}\xi^3\right]\\
&\le t_e\xi^2\left(5512+\frac{10816}{3}\xi\right)
 \le\frac{16705}{3}t_e\xi^2<5600t_e\xi^2 .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.3}
\]
The \(t_e\) factor vanishes exactly at the identity angles.
The estimate is uniform in \(s_e\), the link position and the exterior
volume. In particular it is not a small-angle Taylor remainder.

For the extensive calculation we also require the full excitation
operator applied to this residual. Define bounded self-adjoint real
operators and centered physical vectors
\[
D_e=J_e-\frac{\xi t_e}{3}W_e^\star,\qquad
r_e^{\,s}=Q_\psi D_e\psi .
\]
The superscript distinguishes the vector from the original integer
\(r_e\), the number of faces at the link.
All these operators preserve smooth functions. Each \(J_e\) is central
link convolution, so it commutes with the kinetic energy and the full
vertex action; \(W_e^\star\) is gauge invariant. Hence \(r_e^{\,s}\)
is a smooth gauge-invariant vector in \(\psi^\perp\).

Here are the estimates for the commutator, including the derivative terms.
Put \(P=P_{\{e\}}\) and \(u_e=Q_{\{e\}}\psi\). The fundamental coefficient
on \(W_e^\star P\psi\) gives
\[
(J_e-t_eI)W_e^\star\psi=(J_e-t_eI)W_e^\star u_e .
\]
The product rule, (3.1)--(3.2) and (10.5) give
\[
\begin{aligned}
E_e(W_e^\star u_e)
 &=\tfrac34W_e^\star u_e+W_e^\star E_e\psi
            -2\nabla_eW_e^\star\cdot\nabla_e\psi,\\
\|E_e(W_e^\star u_e)\|
 &\le4r_e^2\xi+4r_e^2\xi+4r_e^2\xi=12r_e^2\xi,\\
\|(J_e-t_eI)W_e^\star\psi\|
 &\le\left(16+\frac{16}{3}\right)r_e^2t_e\xi
   =\frac{64}{3}r_e^2t_e\xi .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.4}
\]
In the last line (20.1) was applied to the first term, while the
second contributes \(t_e\|W_e^\star u_e\|\le16r_e^2t_e\xi/3\).

Since \(H_0W_e^\star=3W_e^\star\) for \(H_0=\sum_fE_f\), exact
commutation with \(H\) yields
\[
\begin{aligned}
Ar_e^{\,s}=[H,D_e]\psi
={}&b(J_e-t_eI)W_e^\star\psi
     -bW_e^\star J_e\psi\\
 &+\frac{2\kappa\xi t_e}{3}
       \sum_f\nabla_fW_e^\star\cdot\nabla_f\psi .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.5}
\]
Only the faces at \(e\) appear in \([V,J_e]\); no other potential
term is deleted from \(H\). The gradient sum has norm at most
\[
\sum_{p\ni e}\sum_{f\in\partial p}2r_f\xi
 \le32r_e\xi.
\]
Also \(\|J_e\psi\|\le(8/3)r_et_e\xi\) by (20.1).
Substitution into (20.5) proves
\[
\|Ar_e^{\,s}\|
 \le\frac{80r_e^2+64r_e}{3}\kappa t_e\xi^2
 \le512\kappa t_e\xi^2,\qquad
\|r_e^{\,s}\|\le5600t_e\xi^2 .
                                                               \tag{20.6}
\]
Every coefficient of (20.2) and (20.5) has been retained and bounded.

## 20.3. Exact finite-range residual energy for arbitrary weights

The support of \(D_e\) is the radius-one link star \(S_e\).
The commutator \([H,D_f]\) has the same radius-one support at \(f\):
\([V,J_f]\) is its face-star commutator, and
\([H,W_f^\star]\) consists of the function's derivatives on that star.
Thus \([D_e,[H,D_f]]=0\) on smooth functions when \(d(e,f)>2\).

For real \(s_e,s_f\), the wavefunctions and operators are real.
Expanding the double commutator and applying \(H\psi=\mathcal E\psi\)
gives the sum of
\(\langle D_e\psi,AD_f\psi\rangle\) and its real transpose.
Self-adjointness and reality make these equal, with no assumption
that \(D_e,D_f\) commute. Centering changes neither energy term.
It follows that
\[
\mathcal R_{ef}:=\langle r_e^{\,s},Ar_f^{\,s}\rangle
=\tfrac12\langle\psi,[D_e,[H,D_f]]\psi\rangle,\qquad
\mathcal R_{ef}=0\ (d(e,f)>2).
                                                               \tag{20.7}
\]
Equation (20.6) gives
\(|\mathcal R_{ef}|\le5600\cdot512\,\kappa\xi^4t_et_f\).
The radius-two link ball has at most \(9^3=729\) links by the
original coordinate count in Sections14 and16. Using
\(2|u_eu_f|\le|u_e|^2+|u_f|^2\) in this symmetric matrix,
\[
\begin{aligned}
r_w^{\,s}&=\sum_e w_er_e^{\,s},\qquad u_e=w_et_e,\\
0\le\mathfrak q_A[r_w^{\,s}]
 &\le3\cdot10^9\kappa\xi^4\|u\|_2^2,\\
\|r_w^{\,s}\|&\le32000\xi^2\|u\|_2
 \qquad(0<\xi\le1/49152).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.8}
\]
The row coefficient is
\(729\cdot5600\cdot512=2090188800<3\cdot10^9\).
For the last line, the independently proved physical gap (15.13)
is at least \(287\kappa/96\) and
\((96/287)3\cdot10^9<32000^2\).
The argument works for real or complex \(w\); the Gram matrix is real
symmetric, so its Hermitian quadratic form has the same bound.
Neither the number of nonzero weights nor an exterior volume factor
appears in these constants.

Let \(\mathsf I\) be the original unsigned face incidence matrix.
The full exact weighted state map is
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal U_s(w)&=Q_\psi\sum_e w_eJ_e\psi,\qquad
 u=(t_ew_e)_e,\quad z=\mathsf Iu,\\
\Phi_z&=\sum_{p\in\mathsf P_L}z_pW_p,\\
\mathcal U_s(w)&=\frac{\xi}{3}Q_\psi\Phi_z\psi+r_w^{\,s}.
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.9}
\]
Indeed \(\sum_ew_et_eW_e^\star=\sum_p(\sum_{e\in\partial p}u_e)W_p\)
by the original face incidence, including all boundary faces.
The diagonal coefficient map \(w\mapsto u\) has kernel
\(\{w:t_ew_e=0\ \text{for every }e\}\), and image the coefficient
arrays vanishing at the zero-angle links. On that image its inverse
on nonzero-angle coordinates is \(w_e=u_e/t_e\); the zero-angle
coordinates are a freely specified kernel. This describes the exact
information loss before incidence or the actual state map is applied.
The residual in (20.9) is not set to zero on \(\ker\mathsf I\).

## 20.4. A nonzero all-angle family with an explicit physical quotient

Write \(\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)\) for the full expression (17.9).
The face block of (17.10), and the full mixed-energy estimate (18.4),
give, with
\[
h_s(w)=\frac{\xi^2}{9}\|z\|_2^2,\qquad
v_s(w)=\frac{\xi}{3}Q_\psi\Phi_z\psi,
\]
\[
\begin{aligned}
\big|\|v_s(w)\|^2-h_s(w)\big|&\le\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)h_s(w),\\
\big|\mathfrak q_A[v_s(w)]-3\kappa h_s(w)\big|
 &\le8\cdot10^6\kappa\xi h_s(w).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.10}
\]
All actual covariance entries, including off-diagonal ones, are in the
left sides; the right sides are the proved operator-norm errors.
These inequalities hold for complex \(z\) as well, because the actual
matrices are real symmetric.

For real \(u\ge0\), \(u\ne0\), each face square is at least the sum of
its coefficient squares. Every original link has \(r_e\ge2\). Hence
\[
\|\mathsf Iu\|_2^2
 =\sum_p\left(\sum_{e\in\partial p}u_e\right)^2
 \ge\sum_e r_eu_e^2\ge2\|u\|_2^2 .
\]
Combining this with (20.8)--(20.10), define the explicit scalar bounds
\[
\begin{aligned}
b_C(\xi)&=\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)
 +2(68000\xi)\sqrt{1+\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)}+(68000\xi)^2,\\
b_N(\xi)&=8\cdot10^6\xi
 +2(120000\xi)\sqrt{3+8\cdot10^6\xi}+(120000\xi)^2 .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.11}
\]
For the norm residual relative to \(\sqrt{h_s(w)}\),
\(3\cdot32000/\sqrt2<68000\). For its energy residual relative to
\(\sqrt{\kappa h_s(w)}\),
\(3\sqrt{3\cdot10^9}/\sqrt2<120000\).
Cauchy--Schwarz in the Hilbert norm and in the nonnegative closed
form therefore proves
\[
\begin{aligned}
\big|\|\mathcal U_s(w)\|^2-h_s(w)\big|&\le b_C(\xi)h_s(w),\\
\big|\mathfrak q_A[\mathcal U_s(w)]-3\kappa h_s(w)\big|
 &\le\kappa b_N(\xi)h_s(w).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.12}
\]
These estimates are now proved for every real angle array and every
original nonnegative \(w\) for which \(u\ne0\).

Here is a completely numerical, volume-independent interval on which the
denominator is positive. The positive cubic polynomial
\(\mathcal P_{\rm mix}\) in (17.9) has
\(\mathcal P_{\rm mix}(48)<10^{13}\), by exact rational substitution.
For \(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\), the function
\(\xi\mathcal P_{\rm mix}(\log(1/\xi))\) increases with \(\xi\):
each monomial has derivative
\(z^r-rz^{r-1}\ge0\), \(z=\log(1/\xi)\ge3\), \(0\le r\le3\).
Also \(\log(10^{16})<48\), since \(e^3>10\).
Consequently \(\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)<10^{-3}\).
The two square roots in (20.11) are each less than two, so exact
rational bounds give
\[
b_C(\xi)<\frac1{500},\qquad b_N(\xi)<10^{-6},\qquad
\frac{b_N(\xi)+3b_C(\xi)}{1-b_C(\xi)}<\frac1{100}
 \quad(0<\xi\le10^{-16}).
                                                               \tag{20.13}
\]
In particular \(\mathcal U_s(w)\ne0\). Subtracting the retained
\(3\kappa\|\mathcal U_s(w)\|^2\) from the energy and applying
(20.12) yields the full quantitative statement
\[
\left|
\frac{\mathfrak q_A[\mathcal U_s(w)]}{\|\mathcal U_s(w)\|^2}
-3\kappa\right|
\le\kappa\,\frac{b_N(\xi)+3b_C(\xi)}{1-b_C(\xi)} .
                                                               \tag{20.14}
\]
This is an all-angle weighted sum of local class-translation states in
the interacting theory. The original product is related to it next.
For signed \(u\) the exact map and bound (20.8)--(20.10) still hold,
but the inequality \(\|\mathsf Iu\|^2\ge2\|u\|^2\) is not asserted.

## 20.5. Every product term and a two-link vacuum moment

For distinct links \(e,f\), the original two-link comparison operator
in Section2 gives a useful bound without a full-volume norm.
Take \(S=\{e,f\}\). In its joint spectral variables
\(\lambda_e,\lambda_f,k\ge0\),
\[
\frac{\lambda_e\lambda_f}
 {\kappa(\lambda_e+\lambda_f)+k}
\le\frac{\lambda_e+\lambda_f}{4\kappa}.
\]
Multiplying \(Q_S\psi=bR_SW_S\psi\) by \(E_eE_f\), which annihilates
\(P_S\psi\), therefore gives
\[
\|E_eE_f\psi\|\le\frac{\xi}{4}\|H_SW_S\psi\|
 \le3\xi+96\xi^2\le4\xi\quad(0<\xi\le1/49152).
                                                               \tag{20.15}
\]
The constants in the middle inequality follow from the full product rule.
There are at most eight faces in \(W_S\); \(\|W_S\|\le16\).
Its local electric derivative has bound
\(\|H_SW_S\|_\infty\le(3/2)(r_e+r_f)\le12\).
The product-rule term \(W_SH_S\psi\) has norm at most
\(16\cdot16\xi=256\xi\).
The mixed derivatives have total norm at most
\(4(r_e^2+r_f^2)\xi\le128\xi\), by (10.4).
Thus \(\|H_SW_S\psi\|\le12+384\xi\), proving (20.15)
with both interaction and derivative terms included.

Take any finite list of distinct translated links \(e_1,\ldots,e_m\)
in the same box, with their specified angles, and set
\(C_i=C_{e_i,s_{e_i}}\), \(J_i=I-C_i\).
These operators commute across different links. Telescoping their product
twice gives the exact identity
\[
\prod_{i=1}^m C_i-I+\sum_{i=1}^mJ_i
 =\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j<i}J_iJ_j\prod_{k<j}C_k .
                                                               \tag{20.16}
\]
An empty product is the identity. Indeed
\(\prod_iC_i-I=-\sum_iJ_i\prod_{k<i}C_k\), and
\(I-\prod_{k<i}C_k=\sum_{j<i}J_j\prod_{k<j}C_k\).
Each \(C_k\) is a contraction. Moving its factors to act after
\(J_iJ_j\) and applying (20.1) twice and (20.15) proves
\[
\left\|\left(\prod_iC_i-I+\sum_iJ_i\right)\psi\right\|
 \le\frac{64}{9}\xi\sum_{j<i}t_{e_i}t_{e_j}.
                                                               \tag{20.17}
\]
This proof retains every term of (20.16); no commutator or product is
replaced by a sum as an identity.

For the original \(K_\theta\), choose all direction-one links and
\(s_e=\theta n_2\); put \(t_e=0\) on the other directions.
With \(z=\mathsf It\), define the native pair sum
\(\mathcal T_2=\sum_{e<f}t_et_f\), over distinct direction-one links.
Its actual centered state satisfies
\[
\begin{aligned}
\chi_\theta&=Q_\psi K_\theta\psi
 =-\mathcal U_s(\mathbf1)+
 Q_\psi\sum_{i}\sum_{j<i}J_iJ_j\prod_{k<j}C_k\psi,\\
\left\|\chi_\theta+\frac{\xi}{3}Q_\psi\Phi_z\psi\right\|
 &\le32000\xi^2\|t\|_2+\frac{64}{9}\xi\mathcal T_2 .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.18}
\]
Thus the original product, the additive local family and the Wilson
coefficient family have exact maps and explicitly bounded differences.
For \(t\ne0\), divide only the error bound by the positive coefficient
size \(\xi\|z\|/3\) to obtain
\[
\varepsilon_{\rm prod}
 =68000\xi+\frac{64}{3}\frac{\mathcal T_2}{\|z\|_2},\qquad
\left|\|\chi_\theta\|-\frac{\xi}{3}\|z\|_2\right|
 \le\frac{\xi}{3}\|z\|_2
 \left(\rho_{\rm mix}(\xi)+\varepsilon_{\rm prod}\right).
                                                               \tag{20.19}
\]
Here \(|\sqrt{1+\epsilon}-1|\le|\epsilon|\) for
\(-1<\epsilon\), applied to (20.10), is valid since
\(\rho_{\rm mix}<10^{-3}\) on the displayed interval
\(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\). The original state is never divided by
a presumed nonzero norm.

## 20.6. Exact native angle sums and the limitation on the prescribed path

All boundary counts can be evaluated before taking any limit.
Put \(t_r=1-\cos(\theta r)\), \(-L\le r\le L\).
There are \(2L(2L+1)\) direction-one links at each height \(r\), giving
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_et_e&=2L(2L+1)\sum_{r=-L}^Lt_r,\\
\sum_et_e^2&=2L(2L+1)\sum_{r=-L}^Lt_r^2,\\
2\mathcal T_2&=\left(\sum_et_e\right)^2-\sum_et_e^2,\\
\|\mathsf It\|^2
 &=2L(2L+1)\sum_{r=-L}^{L-1}(t_r+t_{r+1})^2
       +4L^2\sum_{r=-L}^L(2t_r)^2 .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{20.20}
\]
The last line counts respectively every 12-face and every 13-face;
the 23-face coefficient is zero because its boundary has no
direction-one edge. The pair identity is the exact expansion of the
square with all diagonal and off-diagonal terms retained.

These estimates do not close the original geometric sequence in the
companion spatial-continuum calculation. This can be established
quantitatively, instead of labeling a divergent bound a result about
the true state. That sequence keeps
\[
L_j=j^2,\quad a_j=\frac1{100j},\quad
D_j=L_{j^2}q_{j^2}+6m_{j^2}^2,\quad
\theta_j=\frac{2\pi}{10^4j^2D_j},\qquad D_j=j^4+O(j^2).
                                                               \tag{20.21}
\]
The last expansion follows from the companion's retained
\(B_T=TJ+C_T\), bounded \(C_T\), and \(T=j^2\); it is not a
replacement of \(D_j\) by its leading term. In particular
\(j^{12}\theta_j^2\to4\pi^2/10^8\) and \(|\theta_j|L_j\to0\).

For every real \(x\), Taylor's integral remainder gives
\[
\left|1-\cos x-\frac{x^2}{2}\right|\le\frac{x^4}{24}.
\]
Uniformly over the original heights, the relative error in
\(t_r=\theta_j^2r^2/2\) is at most
\(\theta_j^2L_j^2/12\); at \(r=0\) both sides are exactly zero.
Let \(S_{1,L},S_{2,L}\) be the unchanged native sums in Section8
and \(w_e^{\rm nat}=n_2^2\) on direction-one links. Thus
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal T_2&=\frac{\theta_j^4}{8}
 (S_{1,L_j}^2-S_{2,L_j})
       \bigl(1+O(\theta_j^2L_j^2)\bigr),\\
\|\mathsf It\|&=\frac{\theta_j^2}{2}\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|
       \bigl(1+O(\theta_j^2L_j^2)\bigr).
\end{aligned}
\]
These relative bounds follow termwise because all coefficients in
the pair sum and in the incidence squares are nonnegative.
The explicit polynomials already proved in Section8 yield
\(S_{1,L}/L^5\to8/3\),
\(S_{2,L}/L^7\to8/5\), and
\(\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|/L^{7/2}\to8/\sqrt5\).
Consequently
\[
\frac1j\frac{\mathcal T_2}{\|\mathsf It\|}
 \longrightarrow\frac{8\sqrt5\,\pi^2}{9\cdot10^8},\qquad
\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm prod}}j
 \longrightarrow\frac{512\sqrt5\,\pi^2}{27\cdot10^8}
                                                               \tag{20.22}
\]
at any fixed allowed \(\xi>0\).
The coefficient in this *upper bound* grows on the prescribed
path. This proves that (20.19) supplies no vanishing relative error
there; it does not prove that the actual difference grows or that
the original state has any particular continuum spectral measure.
The local weighted result (20.14) is retained at its proved scope,
but this triangle estimate alone does not control the centered
product error (20.16). Section22 subsequently controls that same
complete norm remainder by an exact exponential/cutoff identity.
Section21 calculates the negative spectral component of that same
product at all positive couplings, without deleting either sign sector
or claiming that this alone controls the whole remainder.

## 20.7. Primary-source dependencies

Section20.1 uses the original full representation and class-averaging
calculation in *Magnetic continuation, Gauss projection, and the
interacting vacuum*, Section4, equations(4.1)--(4.5). The complete
local-resolvent, score and physical-gap proofs used here are Sections2--4,
10 and15 of this repository, with their cited human sources.

The covariance input (17.10) is derived from Bruno Nachtergaele and
Robert Sims, *On the dynamics of lattice systems with unbounded on-site
terms in the Hamiltonian*,
[arXiv:1410.8174v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8174v1), Section3,
and their *Lieb--Robinson Bounds and the Exponential Clustering Theorem*,
[arXiv:math-ph/0506030v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0506030v3),
Section3.2. The retained original TeX loci378--615 and440--723 were
reread for this continuation. The exact dictionary uses link sites,
\(H_e=\kappa E_e\), \(\Phi(\partial p)=-bW_p\), and the untouched
scalar \(2bM\). The crossing-set and Gaussian spectral-integral proofs
are given in Sections13,16 and17; the filter is not a replacement
Gaussian state. Their application here is to the full face blocks,
with the already calculated support and row constants retained.

The prescribed sequence (20.21) is read directly from

# 21. Negative magnetic-sector weights of the original interacting state

This section computes spectral weights of the original product, not only
its possible eigenvalues. No negative eigenvalue is deleted, and no
positivity condition is imposed on the magnetic class operator. The
following estimates hold for every finite original box and every
\(\xi>0\), with their full coupling polynomials retained. They do not
use the small-coupling spectral gap from Sections12 and15.

## 21.1. Joint coordinates and exact spectral projections

Use the original Haar Hilbert space of Section1, the endpoint convention
of Section15.1, and the class multipliers of Section20.1. A link
label array is \(\boldsymbol j=(j_e)_{e\in\mathsf E_L}\), with
\(j_e\in\frac12\mathbb N_0\). Write \(\mathscr H_{\boldsymbol j}\)
for its full matrix-coefficient block, with the inherited Haar inner
product, and \(P_{\boldsymbol j}\) for its orthogonal projection.
Neither a representation nor a matrix-coefficient multiplicity is
removed. The finite-graph construction in John C. Baez,
*Spin Network States in Gauge Theory*,
[arXiv:gr-qc/9411007v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9411007v1),
Section2, gives this direct sum and its vertex-invariant subspaces.
The inverse-link convention map and all boundary gauge actions are
already written and proved in Section15.1.

For the actual angle array \(s=(s_e)_e\), set
\[
K_s=\prod_{e\in\mathsf E_L}C_{e,s_e},\qquad
k_s(\boldsymbol j)=\prod_{e\in\mathsf E_L}c_{j_e}(s_e),\qquad
\psi_{\boldsymbol j}=P_{\boldsymbol j}\psi .
\]
Identity-angle factors are retained. The coefficients \(c_j\) are
exactly the finite character sums in Section20.1, so
\[
K_s|_{\mathscr H_{\boldsymbol j}}
 =k_s(\boldsymbol j)I,\qquad
\sum_{\boldsymbol j}\|\psi_{\boldsymbol j}\|^2=1,\qquad
\bar k_s:=\langle\psi,K_s\psi\rangle
 =\sum_{\boldsymbol j}k_s(\boldsymbol j)\|\psi_{\boldsymbol j}\|^2 .
                                                               \tag{21.1}
\]
The series for \(\bar k_s\) is absolutely convergent, since
\(|k_s(\boldsymbol j)|\le1\).

Define
\[
\Pi_s^-F=\sum_{k_s(\boldsymbol j)<0}P_{\boldsymbol j}F,\qquad
\mathscr H_s^-=\mathop{\widehat\bigoplus}_{k_s(\boldsymbol j)<0}
                    \mathscr H_{\boldsymbol j},\qquad
\mathscr H_s^{\ge0}=\mathop{\widehat\bigoplus}_{k_s(\boldsymbol j)\ge0}
                    \mathscr H_{\boldsymbol j}.
                                                               \tag{21.2}
\]
The orthogonal series converge for every \(F\in\mathcal H_L\).
Consequently \(\Pi_s^-\) is a bounded self-adjoint idempotent, its
image is exactly \(\mathscr H_s^-\), and its kernel is exactly
\(\mathscr H_s^{\ge0}\). The map
\(F\mapsto(\Pi_s^-F,(I-\Pi_s^-)F)\) is an isometric bijection
\(\mathcal H_L\to\mathscr H_s^-\oplus\mathscr H_s^{\ge0}\);
its inverse is \((F_-,F_{\ge0})\mapsto F_-+F_{\ge0}\).
These claims follow term by term from orthogonality, including the
norm identity for the two components. They hold also on the
gauge-invariant subspace: each link Casimir block is invariant under
both endpoint transformations, so all displayed projections commute
with every vertex action.

For any label array, \(k_s(\boldsymbol j)<0\) means that none of its
factors is zero and an odd number of them is negative. In particular
it implies at least one negative factor. Let
\(\Pi_{e,s_e}^-=\mathbf1_{(-\infty,0)}(C_{e,s_e})\). Comparison of
the diagonal multipliers proves the bounded-operator inequality
\[
0\le\Pi_s^-\le\sum_e\Pi_{e,s_e}^- .                            \tag{21.3}
\]
The right side counts all negative factors, not only their parity.
It is an upper bound and is not substituted for the projector.
Arrays with a zero factor stay in \(\mathscr H_s^{\ge0}\).

## 21.2. Full electric moments and the negative-sector bound

We first retain an all-positive-coupling version of the moment used
in (13.2). For \(S=\{e\}\), Section2 constructs
\(K_{\{e\}}\ge0\) on the unchanged exterior space. In joint electric
and exterior spectral variables, the reduced resolvent has multiplier
\((\kappa\lambda+k)^{-1}\), \(\lambda\ge3/4,\ k\ge0\).
It follows from
\(\lambda^2/(\kappa\lambda+k)\le\lambda/\kappa\) and
\(Q_{\{e\}}\psi=bR_{\{e\}}W_e^\star\psi\) that
\[
\|E_e^2\psi\|\le\xi\|E_e(W_e^\star\psi)\|.
\]
The complete product rule is
\[
E_e(W_e^\star\psi)
 =\tfrac34W_e^\star\psi+W_e^\star E_e\psi
       -2\sum_a(X_{e,a}W_e^\star)(X_{e,a}\psi).
\]
The all-positive-coupling estimates (3.1) and (10.5) are
\(\|E_e\psi\|\le2r_e\xi\) and
\(\|\nabla_e\psi\|^2=\gamma_e\le4r_e^2\xi^2\).
Also \(\|W_e^\star\|_\infty\le2r_e\) and
\(\|\nabla_eW_e^\star\|_\infty\le r_e\), with the original
radius-two group metric. Hence the three retained terms have
norms at most \(3r_e/2,\ 4r_e^2\xi,\ 4r_e^2\xi\), respectively.
Thus, without a small-\(\xi\) assumption,
\[
\|E_e^2\psi\|\le
M_{2,e}(\xi):=\frac{3r_e}{2}\xi+8r_e^2\xi^2
\le(6+128\xi)\xi .                                           \tag{21.4}
\]
All vectors used in this resolvent calculation are smooth; alternatively,
finite joint spectral cutoffs followed by monotone summation prove the
same domain statement and norm inequality.

Put \(t_e=1-\cos s_e\). On a negative one-link class eigenspace,
(20.1) gives
\[
1<1-c_{j_e}(s_e)\le\frac43t_e\lambda_e,\qquad
\lambda_e=j_e(j_e+1).
\]
Therefore, on every link block, including nonnegative blocks,
\[
\mathbf1_{\{c_{j_e}(s_e)<0\}}
 \le \left(\frac43t_e\lambda_e\right)^4 .
\]
Apply this scalar inequality to the squared norms of the vacuum's
orthogonal components and use (21.4). This proves
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\Pi_{e,s_e}^-\psi\|^2
 &\le\frac{256}{81}t_e^4M_{2,e}(\xi)^2,\\
\|\Pi_s^-\psi\|^2
 &\le\frac{256}{81}\sum_e t_e^4M_{2,e}(\xi)^2
 \le\frac{256}{81}(6+128\xi)^2\xi^2\sum_e t_e^4 .
\end{aligned}                                                 \tag{21.5}
\]
The second line uses (21.3) before taking the vacuum expectation.
At \(t_e=0\), the entire class operator is the identity and its
negative projector is zero; no division by \(t_e\) was made.
Large angles and negative coefficients remain allowed. The estimate
may be large there, but its proof never replaces \(C_{e,s_e}\) by a
positive operator.

The original centered product state is
\(\chi_s=Q_\psi K_s\psi=(K_s-\bar k_s)\psi\), since
\(\|\psi\|=1\). Its exact negative-sector weight is
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\Pi_s^-\chi_s\|^2
 &=\sum_{k_s(\boldsymbol j)<0}
       |k_s(\boldsymbol j)-\bar k_s|^2
                     \|\psi_{\boldsymbol j}\|^2,\\
\|\Pi_s^-K_s\psi\|^2
 &=\sum_{k_s(\boldsymbol j)<0}
       |k_s(\boldsymbol j)|^2\|\psi_{\boldsymbol j}\|^2 .
\end{aligned}                                                 \tag{21.6}
\]
This keeps the actual centering term: \(\Pi_s^-\) need not commute
with \(Q_\psi\). Since \(|\bar k_s|\le1\), (21.5)--(21.6) give
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\Pi_s^-K_s\psi\|&\le
 \frac{16}{9}(6+128\xi)\xi\left(\sum_et_e^4\right)^{1/2},\\
\|\Pi_s^-\chi_s\|&\le
 \frac{32}{9}(6+128\xi)\xi\left(\sum_et_e^4\right)^{1/2}.
\end{aligned}                                                 \tag{21.7}
\]
These are actual-vacuum estimates for the complete product at every
positive coupling. They do not require any denominator estimate for
\(\chi_s\).

## 21.3. An exact bound on the retained vacuum coefficient

For scalars \(c_i\in[-1,1]\), the complete telescope gives
\[
1-\prod_i c_i=\sum_i(1-c_i)\prod_{k<i}c_k,\qquad
0\le1-\prod_i c_i\le\sum_i(1-c_i).
\]
The lower bound uses \(\prod_i c_i\le1\); the upper bound uses
absolute values of every prefix, which are at most one.
Consequently, by the same joint spectral sums,
\[
0\le I-K_s\le\sum_e J_e,\qquad
0\le1-\bar k_s
 \le\frac43\sum_e t_e\gamma_e
 \le\frac{16}{3}\xi^2\sum_e r_e^2t_e
 \le\frac{256}{3}\xi^2\sum_e t_e .                             \tag{21.8}
\]
No sign of a prefix has been assumed. The middle inequality is the
expectation of (20.1); all first and second electric moments are those
of \(\psi\), not the free vacuum. In particular (21.8) quantifies the
vacuum component removed by \(Q_\psi\) in (21.6).

## 21.4. Exact native counts and the unchanged cusp sequence

Specialize only now to the original direction-one angles
\(s_{(n,1)}=\theta n_2\), with identity factors on the other links.
The exact additional count is
\[
S_{4,L}(\theta):=\sum_e t_e^4
 =2L(2L+1)\sum_{r=-L}^{L}\bigl(1-\cos(\theta r)\bigr)^4 .
                                                               \tag{21.9}
\]
Together with (20.20), this is a finite formula for all bounds above.
For the prescribed \(L_j,a_j,D_j,\theta_j\) of (20.21), set
\(z_j=\mathsf I t^{(j)}\). For all sufficiently large \(j\),
\(0<|\theta_j|L_j<\pi\). Thus \(t^{(j)}\ne0\) and
\(\|z_j\|>0\), because all coefficients are nonnegative and every
link is in a face.

Here is the full power count in the original coordinates. The exact
polynomial
\[
Q_8(L)=\frac29L^9+L^8+\frac43L^7
                   -\frac{14}{15}L^5+\frac49L^3-\frac1{15}L
\]
satisfies \(Q_8(0)=0\) and
\(Q_8(L)-Q_8(L-1)=2L^8\): expanding each
\((L-1)^m=\sum_{r=0}^m\binom mr L^r(-1)^{m-r}\) gives the
stated difference with all other coefficients zero.
Induction therefore proves \(Q_8(L)=\sum_{r=-L}^Lr^8\).

For \(r\ne0\) the Taylor bound in Section20.6 writes
\[
t_r=\frac{\theta_j^2r^2}{2}(1+\epsilon_{j,r}),\qquad
|\epsilon_{j,r}|\le\delta_j:=\frac{\theta_j^2L_j^2}{12}\longrightarrow0.
\]
The \(r=0\) term is exactly zero. Once \(\delta_j<1\), termwise
comparison gives the explicit two-sided bounds
\[
\begin{aligned}
(1-\delta_j)^4 A_j&\le S_{4,L_j}(\theta_j)
                                      \le(1+\delta_j)^4 A_j,\\
A_j&=\frac{\theta_j^8}{16}\,2L_j(2L_j+1)Q_8(L_j),\\
(1-\delta_j)\frac{\theta_j^2}{2}\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|
 &\le\|z_j\|
 \le(1+\delta_j)\frac{\theta_j^2}{2}\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|.
\end{aligned}                                                 \tag{21.10}
\]
The last pair follows first coordinatewise through the nonnegative
incidence matrix and then by the squared Euclidean norm. In particular,
using \(Q_8(L)/L^9\to2/9\) and the exact Section8 native norm,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{S_{4,L_j}(\theta_j)}{\theta_j^8L_j^{11}}&\longrightarrow\frac1{18},\\
\frac{\|z_j\|}{\theta_j^2L_j^{7/2}}&\longrightarrow\frac4{\sqrt5},\\
j^8\frac{\sqrt{S_{4,L_j}(\theta_j)}}{\|z_j\|}
 &\longrightarrow\frac{\sqrt{10}\,\pi^2}{6\cdot10^8}.
\end{aligned}                                                 \tag{21.11}
\]
For the last limit, the quotient of the first two square-root scale
constants is \(\sqrt{10}/24\), and the unchanged period relation
\(D_j=j^4+O(j^2)\) gives
\(j^8\theta_j^2L_j^2\to4\pi^2/10^8\).
No coefficient of \(D_j\), no lattice link, and no cover parameter
has been substituted out of the finite formulas.

Define the positive *coefficient size*
\(h_j^{1/2}=\xi\|z_j\|/3\), as in Section20. It is not a
replacement for \(\|\chi_{\theta_j}\|\). Combining (21.7) and
(21.11), for every fixed \(\xi>0\), proves
\[
\limsup_{j\to\infty}
 j^8\,\frac{\|\Pi_{\theta_j}^-\chi_{\theta_j}\|}{\xi\|z_j\|/3}
 \le\frac{16(6+128\xi)\sqrt{10}\,\pi^2}{9\cdot10^8}.
                                                               \tag{21.12}
\]
Thus this component is \(O(\xi j^{-13})\) at each fixed positive
coupling, whereas the displayed coefficient size is of order
\(\xi j^{-5}\). Equation (21.12) is not a statement about its
fraction of the actual state norm; that norm has not been divided
out. At \(0<\xi\le1/49152\) the coefficient \(6+128\xi\) is at
most seven, but that restriction is unnecessary for this result.

The original first sum also satisfies
\(j^2\sum_e t_e^{(j)}\to16\pi^2/(3\cdot10^8)\), by (20.20)
and the same termwise bounds. Hence (21.8) gives, still at every
fixed positive coupling,
\[
0\le1-\bar k_{\theta_j},\qquad
\limsup_{j\to\infty}j^2(1-\bar k_{\theta_j})
 \le\frac{4096\pi^2}{9\cdot10^8}\xi^2 .                        \tag{21.13}
\]
Both the vacuum coefficient and the negative-sector weight were
computed for the original product, not its additive substitute.

## 21.5. The full Hamiltonian map and the remaining product calculation

The spectral projection in (21.2) commutes with
\(\kappa\sum_eE_e\), since both are diagonal on every full link-label
block. In particular it preserves the domain of that operator and,
because the original potential is bounded at each finite box, the
domain of \(H\). For every \(F\in\operatorname{Dom}H\), the exact
map is
\[
(H-\mathcal E)\Pi_s^-F
 =\Pi_s^-(H-\mathcal E)F
          -b\sum_{p\in\mathsf P_L}[W_p,\Pi_s^-]F .
                                                               \tag{21.14}
\]
This follows by expanding \(H=\kappa\sum E_e+2bM-b\sum W_p\);
the scalar \(2bM\) and the full kinetic term commute with the
projection, and every face commutator remains. Each commutator is
bounded, with norm at most four, so the finite sum is defined on
the whole Hilbert space. Projecting (21.14) onto the complementary
spectral subspace displays the actual off-diagonal Hamiltonian block.
No assertion that this block vanishes is made. The same calculation
holds on the gauge-invariant subspace.

Equations (21.5)--(21.14) retain the negative magnetic eigenspaces
and compute their actual weights and Hamiltonian coupling. They
neither identify magnetic eigenvalues with Hamiltonian energies nor
remove the negative eigenvectors of Section19. In particular they
do not prove that \(\chi_{\theta_j}\) has a nonzero limiting
normalization or a particular excitation spectral measure.
This negative-sector estimate alone does not control the complete
centered remainder (20.16); its upper bound in (20.22) is not improved
merely by deleting the negative sector. Section22 subsequently supplies
the complete norm remainder and actual denominator on its stated
coupling interval, with the original cusp and both sign sectors retained.

# 22. The complete product remainder on the unchanged cusp

We now bound the complete centered remainder (20.16), not just one
magnetic sign component. The Hamiltonian, its actual vacuum and all
angles remain unchanged. An auxiliary exponential and an electric
spectral cutoff enter only inside exact difference identities; all
differences are bounded before the original product is recovered.
The general comparison holds for every positive coupling. The
nonzero denominator and spectral-probability comparison use the
already proved interval \(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\).

## 22.1. Exact two-band multiplication and a third electric moment

Here is a coordinate proof of the fundamental tensor-product rule
needed for the new domain estimate. Let
\(\mathcal P_n=\operatorname{Sym}^n\mathbb C^2\), realized as formal
homogeneous polynomials in \(z_1,z_2\), with the induced \(SU(2)\)
action. For \(n\ge1\), write an element of
\(\mathcal P_n\otimes\mathbb C^2\) as
\(v=p_1\otimes e_1+p_2\otimes e_2\), and define
\[
\begin{aligned}
m_n(v)&=z_1p_1+z_2p_2\in\mathcal P_{n+1},\\
s_n(r)&=\frac1{n+1}
  \bigl((\partial_1r)\otimes e_1+(\partial_2r)\otimes e_2\bigr),\\
\iota_n(q)&=-z_2q\otimes e_1+z_1q\otimes e_2,\qquad q\in\mathcal P_{n-1}.
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.1}
\]
Multiplication is equivariant, and \(s_n\) is the polarization map:
the chain rule proves equivariance under each linear change of the
two basis vectors. The tensor \(z_1\otimes e_2-z_2\otimes e_1\)
is multiplied by the determinant, which is one for \(SU(2)\);
therefore \(\iota_n\) is equivariant too. Euler's identity for
homogeneous polynomials gives \(m_ns_n=I\), and direct substitution
gives \(m_n\iota_n=0\).

If \(z_1p_1+z_2p_2=0\), evaluation at \(z_1=0\) shows that \(z_1\)
divides \(p_2\); evaluation at \(z_2=0\) shows that \(z_2\) divides
\(p_1\). Thus there is a unique polynomial \(q\in\mathcal P_{n-1}\)
with \(p_1=-z_2q,\ p_2=z_1q\). This proves
\(\ker m_n=\operatorname{im}\iota_n\), and \(\iota_n\) is
injective. In full coordinates the bijection and inverse are
\[
\begin{aligned}
v&\longmapsto(r,q),\qquad r=m_n(v),\\
q&=\frac{p_2-(n+1)^{-1}\partial_2r}{z_1}
  =-\frac{p_1-(n+1)^{-1}\partial_1r}{z_2},\\
(r,q)&\longmapsto s_n(r)+\iota_n(q).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.2}
\]
The quotients in (22.2) are polynomial divisions proved exact above,
not pointwise divisions requiring \(z_1z_2\ne0\).
For \(n=0\), \(m_0:\mathcal P_0\otimes\mathbb C^2\to\mathcal P_1\)
is already a bijection with inverse \(s_0\), and there is no
\(\mathcal P_{-1}\) summand.

For completeness, \(\mathcal P_n\) is irreducible: the diagonal torus
has the distinct weights of the monomials \(z_1^{n-r}z_2^r\).
A nonzero invariant subspace contains a weight vector by finite
torus projection. The complexified raising and lowering operators
\(z_1\partial_2,z_2\partial_1\) connect that monomial to every
other one with nonzero displayed integer coefficients. Consequently
the subspace is all of \(\mathcal P_n\). These are the original
spin-\(n/2\) spaces with electric eigenvalue
\(\lambda_n=n(n+2)/4\), in the unchanged \(T_a=-i\sigma_a/2\)
convention. Thus (22.1)--(22.2) prove the two tensor-product bands
\(n+1,n-1\). No isometry of the polynomial splitting is assumed;
all Hilbert estimates below use the original Haar orthogonal
Peter--Weyl projections.

Let \(P_n^{(e)}\) denote the one-link electric projection on label
\(n=2j_e\), tensored with the unchanged exterior identity. Each
\(W_p\) at \(e\) is linear in the entries of \(U_e\) or \(U_e^{-1}\).
For a determinant-one matrix
\(U_e=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)\),
its inverse is
\(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}d&-b\\-c&a\end{smallmatrix}\right)\),
so these are all fundamental matrix coefficients. The product
of two matrix coefficients is a coefficient of the tensor product.
Equation (22.2) therefore proves
\[
P_m^{(e)}W_e^\star P_n^{(e)}=0
       \quad\text{unless }m=n+1\text{ or }m=n-1 .
                                                               \tag{22.3}
\]
This retains the sum over every face at \(e\).

For each fixed sign define
\(T_\pm=\sum_{n\ge0}P_{n\pm1}^{(e)}W_e^\star P_n^{(e)}\),
omitting the negative label. For a finite sum of input blocks,
the corresponding output blocks of a fixed \(T_\pm\) are
orthogonal and distinct. Hence
\(\|T_\pm F\|^2\le\|W_e^\star\|_\infty^2\sum_n\|P_n^{(e)}F\|^2\).
This proves bounded extension with norm at most \(2r_e\), and
(22.3) gives \(W_e^\star=T_++T_-\).
The retained eigenvalues obey
\[
\lambda_{n+1}+1\le2(\lambda_n+1),\qquad
\lambda_{n-1}+1\le2(\lambda_n+1)\quad(n\ge1).
\]
For the plus sign the difference on the right is
\((n^2+1)/4>0\); the minus sign follows from
\((n^2+3)/4\le(n^2+2n+4)/2\).
Applying these scalar bounds to each of the orthogonal bands gives
\[
\|E_e^2(W_e^\star F)\|
 \le8\|W_e^\star\|_\infty\|(E_e+I)^2F\|
 \le16r_e\|(E_e+I)^2F\|,
\quad F\in\operatorname{Dom}E_e^2 .                            \tag{22.4}
\]
Indeed the norm of each band is at most
\(4\|W_e^\star\|_\infty\|(E_e+I)^2F\|\).
Finite electric truncations and closedness of \(E_e^2\) justify
the full domain statement in (22.4).

The same exact one-link comparison as in (21.4) has multiplier
\(\lambda^3/(\kappa\lambda+k)\le\lambda^2/\kappa\).
Using \(\psi\)'s smoothness and the full product estimate (22.4),
with no exterior gap assumption, proves for every \(\xi>0\)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|E_e^3\psi\|
 &\le \xi\|E_e^2(W_e^\star\psi)\|\\
 &\le16r_e\xi\bigl(1+4r_e\xi+M_{2,e}(\xi)\bigr)\\
 &\le M_3(\xi):=64\xi(1+22\xi+128\xi^2).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.5}
\]
Here \(\|(E_e+I)^2\psi\|\le
\|E_e^2\psi\|+2\|E_e\psi\|+\|\psi\|\); every term is kept.
This is a volume-independent moment of the interacting vacuum.

## 22.2. Complete product-to-exponential identity, with negative factors

Keep \(J_e=I-C_{e,s_e}\), \(t_e=1-\cos s_e\), and define
\[
S=\sum_eJ_e,\qquad T_1=\sum_et_e,\qquad T_2=\sum_et_e^2,
\qquad K_s=\prod_eC_{e,s_e}.
\]
The symbol \(T_2\) here is the diagonal sum, not the pair sum
\(\mathcal T_2\) in Section20. All these sums are finite at the
original regulator. On the exact link-label coordinates, \(J_e\)
has a scalar \(x_e\in[0,2]\).
For \(x\ge0\), two integrations of the derivative of \(e^{-x}\)
give
\[
1-x-e^{-x}=-\int_0^x(x-v)e^{-v}\,dv,\qquad
|1-x-e^{-x}|\le x^2/2 .
\]
For any enumeration of the links the complete product identity is
\[
K_s-e^{-S}
 =\sum_i(C_i-e^{-J_i})
          \prod_{k<i}C_k\prod_{k>i}e^{-J_k}.
                                                               \tag{22.6}
\]
It follows by replacing one factor at a time; the commutation
between distinct links also proves \(e^{-S}=\prod_i e^{-J_i}\).
Every factor other than the displayed difference is a contraction,
including negative \(C_k\) eigenvalues. Those factors commute with
the difference and can be moved after it when taking its norm.
Since \(\|J_e^2\psi\|\le(16/9)t_e^2\|E_e^2\psi\|\), (21.4) gives
\[
\|(K_s-e^{-S})\psi\|
 \le A_s:=\frac89(6+128\xi)\xi T_2 .                            \tag{22.7}
\]
No product factor is omitted. The auxiliary exponential has no
interpretation here as a replacement Hamiltonian or vacuum.

## 22.3. Cutoff remainder and an exact centered state identity

For a positive real number \(\Lambda\), let
\[
B=\sum_eJ_e\mathbf1_{[0,\Lambda]}(E_e),\qquad
D=S-B,\qquad R_\Lambda=\frac43\Lambda T_1 .
\]
These are functions of the same commuting link spectra, and
\(0\le B\le R_\Lambda I,\ D\ge0\). The vacuum is not truncated.
On the tail \(\lambda>\Lambda\),
\(\lambda\le\lambda^3/\Lambda^2\); thus (20.1),(22.5) give
\[
\|D\psi\|\le d_\Lambda:=
 \frac43\,M_3(\xi)\frac{T_1}{\Lambda^2},\qquad
\|(e^{-S}-e^{-B})\psi\|\le d_\Lambda .                         \tag{22.8}
\]
For the second inequality, on the common spectrum
\(0\le e^{-B}-e^{-S}\le S-B\), since both \(B,S\) are nonnegative.
The norm inequality follows by squaring this scalar comparison
and summing the original vacuum spectral weights.

Put \(\beta=\langle\psi,B\psi\rangle\). Then
\[
0\le\beta\le\min\{R_\Lambda,m_s\},\qquad
m_s:=\frac{256}{3}\xi^2T_1,                                  \tag{22.9}
\]
by \(\langle\psi,J_e\psi\rangle\le(4/3)t_e\gamma_e\)
and the all-coupling score bound. For \(0\le x\le R_\Lambda\),
Taylor's integral formula about \(\beta\) gives
\[
F_\beta(x)=e^{-x}-e^{-\beta}+e^{-\beta}(x-\beta),\qquad
|F_\beta(x)|\le\frac12|x-\beta|^2
             \le\frac{R_\Lambda}{2}|x-\beta|.
\]
The same formula holds for \(x<\beta\): the second derivative
\(e^{-v}\) is at most one throughout the interval between two
nonnegative endpoints. Applying it to \(B\) proves
\[
\|Q_\psi F_\beta(B)\psi\|
 \le\frac{R_\Lambda}{2}\|Q_\psi B\psi\| .
                                                               \tag{22.10}
\]

Write \(\mathcal U=Q_\psi S\psi=\mathcal U_s(\mathbf1)\) and
\(\chi=Q_\psi K_s\psi\), exactly as in Section20.
All terms of the following identity are in the original Hilbert space:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\chi+\mathcal U={}&
 Q_\psi(K_s-e^{-S})\psi+Q_\psi(e^{-S}-e^{-B})\psi\\
 &+Q_\psi F_\beta(B)\psi
 +(1-e^{-\beta})\mathcal U+e^{-\beta}Q_\psi D\psi .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.11}
\]
To verify it, substitute
\(Q_\psi e^{-B}\psi=-e^{-\beta}Q_\psi B\psi+
Q_\psi F_\beta(B)\psi\) and
\(Q_\psi B\psi=\mathcal U-Q_\psi D\psi\); the scalar term
is killed only by the actual vacuum projection.
Using \(1-e^{-\beta}\le\beta\), (22.7)--(22.10), and
\(\|Q_\psi B\psi\|\le\|\mathcal U\|+d_\Lambda\), gives
\[
\boxed{\ 
\|\chi+\mathcal U\|
 \le A_s+(2+R_\Lambda/2)d_\Lambda
                +(R_\Lambda/2+m_s)\|\mathcal U\| .
\ }                                                            \tag{22.12}
\]
This holds at every positive coupling, every real angle array and
every positive cutoff. The right side controls the *complete*
centered product remainder, equal to \(Q_\psi\) applied to the
right side of (20.16). Both sign sectors and all pair/prefix terms
remain in the exact identity; no independence of vacuum variables
has been assumed.

## 22.4. A vanishing bound on the prescribed, unaltered sequence

Now fix \(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\). Let
\(z=\mathsf It\), \(c_s=\xi\|z\|/3\), for an angle array with
\(t\ne0\). Since \(t\ge0\), \(\|z\|>0\).
The already proved (20.12) gives
\[
c_s\sqrt{1-b_C(\xi)}\le\|\mathcal U\|
                  \le c_s\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)} .
\]
Define, with every finite-regulator sum still present,
\[
\begin{aligned}
p(\xi)&=1+22\xi+128\xi^2,\qquad q(\xi)=6+128\xi,\\
a_s&=\frac83q(\xi)\frac{T_2}{\|z\|},\qquad
e_\Lambda=256p(\xi)\frac{T_1}{\Lambda^2\|z\|},\\
\varepsilon_s(\Lambda)&=
a_s+(2+R_\Lambda/2)e_\Lambda
          +(R_\Lambda/2+m_s)\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)} .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.13}
\]
These quantities are respectively \(A_s/c_s,d_\Lambda/c_s\)
and the full bound obtained from (22.12). Hence
\[
\|\chi+\mathcal U\|\le c_s\varepsilon_s(\Lambda).
                                                               \tag{22.14}
\]
For identity angles everywhere, the un-divided identity gives
\(\chi=\mathcal U=0\); no definition of \(c_s^{-1}\) is needed.

Use the exact original sequence (20.21), including
\(D_j=L_{j^2}q_{j^2}+6m_{j^2}^2\), and choose only the auxiliary
spectral cutoff
\(\Lambda_j=j^{5/3}\). This does not change the original \(L_j\),
\(a_j\), \(\theta_j\), \(D_j\), state, or Hamiltonian.
Write \(c_j=\xi\|z_j\|/3\) and
\(\varepsilon_j=\varepsilon_{s^{(j)}}(\Lambda_j)\).
The exact finite sums of Section20 give
\[
\begin{aligned}
j^2T_{1,j}&\longrightarrow\frac{16\pi^2}{3\cdot10^8},\\
j^{-3}\frac{T_{1,j}}{\|z_j\|}&\longrightarrow\frac{\sqrt5}{3},\\
j^5\frac{T_{2,j}}{\|z_j\|}&\longrightarrow\frac{2\pi^2}{\sqrt5\cdot10^8},\\
j^5c_j&\longrightarrow\frac{16\pi^2\xi}{3\sqrt5\cdot10^8}.
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.15}
\]
Here the first two follow from
\(T_1=(\theta_j^2/2)S_{1,L_j}(1+o(1))\) and
\(\|z_j\|=(\theta_j^2/2)\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|(1+o(1))\).
For the third retain
\(T_2=(\theta_j^4/4)S_{2,L_j}(1+o(1))\),
\(S_{2,L}/L^7\to8/5\), and
\(\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|/L^{7/2}\to8/\sqrt5\).
All relative errors here are bounded by the termwise Taylor errors
in (21.10); the original finite formulas are not replaced by limits.

Substitution of these four limits into every term of (22.13)
now proves
\[
j^{1/3}\varepsilon_j\longrightarrow
\frac{32\pi^2}{9\cdot10^8}\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)}
                     +\frac{512\sqrt5}{3}p(\xi).
                                                               \tag{22.16}
\]
The term \(a_s\) is \(O(j^{-5})\), \(m_s\) is \(O(j^{-2})\),
and the product \(R_\Lambda e_\Lambda\) is \(O(j^{-2/3})\);
none contributes to this limit. Thus \(\varepsilon_j\to0\)
on the original sequence at each fixed allowed positive coupling.
This improves the bound failure (20.22) by a proved estimate on
the same complete remainder, not by a different cusp.

Here is also an explicit eventual nonzero-state threshold, so the
existence of a denominator is not an additional hypothesis.
Let \(C_{\rm per}\) be the finite bound
\(\sup_{T\ge T_0}\|C_T\|\) for the retained period correction
\(B_T=TJ+C_T\) in the companion's original Section2.
Take a dyadic \(j\) with
\[
j\ge2,\qquad j^2\ge T_0,\qquad j^2\ge2C_{\rm per}.
\]
Then \(D_j\ge j^4/4\), and
\(\theta_j\le(8\pi/10^4)j^{-6}\). In particular
\(0<\theta_jL_j<1\), so \(t^{(j)}\ne0\).
The original direction-one edge count is
\(N_1=2L(2L+1)^2\le18L^3\). Cauchy--Schwarz and the
nonnegative incidence inequality prove
\[
\frac{T_1}{\|z\|}\le\sqrt{N_1/2}\le3j^3 .
\]
Also \(S_{1,L}\le12L^5\), since
\(2L(2L+1)\le6L^2\) and \(\sum_{r=-L}^Lr^2\le2L^3\).
Using \(t_r\le\theta_j^2r^2/2\) and the retained \(\pi<4\) bound,
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_{1,j}&\le\frac{6144}{10^8}j^{-2},&
R_{\Lambda_j}/2&\le\frac{4096}{10^8}j^{-1/3}<1,\\
m_{s^{(j)}}&\le\frac{524288}{10^8}j^{-2},&
e_{\Lambda_j}&\le1536j^{-1/3}.
\end{aligned}
\]
We used only \(p(\xi)<2,\ q(\xi)<7,\ \xi^2\le1\) here.
For the other term, \(T_2/\|z\|\le\sqrt{T_2/2}\),
\(\sqrt{T_2}\le(\theta_j^2L_j^2/2)\sqrt{N_1}\), so
\(a_s\le28\theta_j^2L_j^{7/2}
 \le(28672/10^8)j^{-5}\).
Finally \(\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)}<2\). Adding the three retained
terms of (22.13) therefore proves the convenient explicit bound
\[
\varepsilon_j\le5000j^{-1/3}.                                \tag{22.17}
\]
For example it holds for every dyadic \(j\) satisfying the preceding
period thresholds, and makes \(\varepsilon_j\le1/4\) whenever
\(j\ge20000^3\).

Since \(b_C<1/500\), the reverse triangle inequality in (22.14)
then proves, with the actual unmodified states,
\[
\frac12c_j\le\|\chi_{\theta_j}\|\le\frac32c_j,
\qquad
\|\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal U_j\|\le c_j\varepsilon_j
\quad
\left(j\ge\max\{2,\sqrt{\max\{T_0,0\}},\sqrt{2C_{\rm per}},20000^3\}\right).
                                                               \tag{22.18}
\]
All \(j\) in this statement are dyadic. This is a proved threshold,
not an assumed nonvanishing denominator. The raw norm is of order
\(\xi j^{-5}\); it has not been set to one.

## 22.5. Full bounded spectral measurements, with both masses retained

At each original regulator let \(A_j=H_j-\mathcal E_j\) be the
actual self-adjoint excitation operator and \(\mathsf P_j(B)\)
its spectral projection for a Borel set \(B\subset\mathbb R\).
For a state \(X\) define its raw finite measure and its total mass
\[
\eta_{X,j}(B)=\langle X,\mathsf P_j(B)X\rangle,\qquad
C_{X,j}=\eta_{X,j}(\mathbb R)=\|X\|^2.
\]
No eigenvalue, energy unit or state is rescaled. For every bounded
operator \(O\) of norm at most one, write
\(r_j=\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal U_j\).
Expanding \(\chi_{\theta_j}=-\mathcal U_j+r_j\) and keeping all
three difference terms gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\langle\chi_{\theta_j},O\chi_{\theta_j}\rangle
 -\langle\mathcal U_j,O\mathcal U_j\rangle
={}&-\langle\mathcal U_j,Or_j\rangle
       -\langle r_j,O\mathcal U_j\rangle+\langle r_j,Or_j\rangle,\\
\left|\langle\chi_{\theta_j},O\chi_{\theta_j}\rangle
 -\langle\mathcal U_j,O\mathcal U_j\rangle\right|
 &\le c_j^2\Theta_j,\qquad
\Theta_j=\varepsilon_j(2\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)}+\varepsilon_j).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.19}
\]
This proves the same estimate for \(O=f(A_j)\), uniformly over
all complex Borel functions with \(|f|\le1\), and for every
original spectral projection. In particular it holds at \(O=I\),
so both total masses are controlled with exactly the same error.

The original spectral-probability quotient retains those masses
explicitly as
\(\mu_{X,j}(B)=\eta_{X,j}(B)/C_{X,j}\).
No raw state or physical parameter is changed by recording that
quotient. For all the dyadic \(j\) in (22.18), both denominators
are now proved positive. Subtract the two fractions, using (22.19)
once for \(f(A_j)\) and once for \(I\), to obtain
\[
\begin{aligned}
\left|
\frac{\int f\,d\eta_{\chi,j}}{C_{\chi,j}}
 -\frac{\int f\,d\eta_{\mathcal U,j}}{C_{\mathcal U,j}}
\right|
&\le\frac{2c_j^2\Theta_j}{C_{\chi,j}}
\le8\Theta_j,\qquad |f|\le1,\\
\|\mu_{\chi,j}-\mu_{\mathcal U,j}\|_{\rm TV}
&\le8\Theta_j\longrightarrow0 .
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.20}
\]
Here the total-variation convention is the supremum over all
measurable \(|f|\le1\). To verify the first line explicitly, the
first fraction difference contributes at most
\(c_j^2\Theta_j/C_{\chi,j}\). The remaining denominator difference
is at most
\(C_{\mathcal U,j}|C_{\mathcal U,j}-C_{\chi,j}|/
(C_{\chi,j}C_{\mathcal U,j})\), which has that same bound.
Finally \(C_{\chi,j}\ge c_j^2/4\) by (22.18).
This is comparison of the entire spectral probabilities of two
specified states of the *same original Hamiltonian*, not convergence
to a newly selected spectrum or a construction of a continuum theory.

Section21's retained negative magnetic projection can also now be
compared to the actual norm, on this proved coupling interval:
\[
\frac{\|\Pi_{\theta_j}^-\chi_{\theta_j}\|^2}{C_{\chi,j}}
\le
4\left[
\frac{32}{3}(6+128\xi)
\frac{\sqrt{S_{4,L_j}(\theta_j)}}{\|z_j\|}
\right]^2
 =O_\xi(j^{-16}).                                             \tag{22.21}
\]
This follows from (21.7) and the lower denominator in (22.18).
It neither deletes that subspace nor reads its magnetic sign as
an energy sign.

## 22.6. The original weighted electric state and its entire spectral measure

The finite-angle sum itself has an exact controlled relation to the
original native electric state. In the spin-\(n/2\) block, retain
\(k_r=2r-n\) and \(\lambda_n=n(n+2)/4\). Direct expansion gives
\[
\frac1{n+1}\sum_{r=0}^n k_r^4
 =\frac{n(n+2)(3n^2+6n-4)}{15}
 =\frac{16}{15}\lambda_n(3\lambda_n-1).
\]
For instance expand the fourth power and use
\(\sum r=n(n+1)/2\), \(\sum r^2=n(n+1)(2n+1)/6\),
\(\sum r^3=n^2(n+1)^2/4\), and
\(\sum r^4=n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3n-1)/30\).
Each of these finite-sum identities follows by subtracting its
polynomial at \(n-1\) from its value at \(n\), obtaining respectively
\(n,n^2,n^3,n^4\), and checking the value zero at \(n=0\).
The same expansion of \(k_r^2\) gave \(4\lambda_n/3\) in Section20.
The full cosine remainder therefore proves
\[
\begin{aligned}
\left|1-c_{n/2}(s)-\frac23s^2\lambda_n\right|
 &\le\frac{s^4}{24}\frac{16}{15}\lambda_n(3\lambda_n-1)
 \le\frac{2}{15}s^4\lambda_n^2,\\
\left\|\left(J_e-\frac23s_e^2E_e\right)\psi\right\|
 &\le\frac{2}{15}s_e^4 M_{2,e}(\xi).
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.22}
\]
The last line is obtained by squaring the scalar inequality and
summing every original link block. It keeps all spins and every
exceptional angle; no equality is inferred from the Taylor estimate.

For the original native weights define, without changing the vector,
\[
v_j=Q_\psi\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2E_e\psi,\qquad
\mathcal Z_j=\frac23\theta_j^2v_j .
\]
Retain \(S_{2,L}=\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^4\) from Section8.
Summing (22.22) before centering proves
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\mathcal U_j-\mathcal Z_j\|
 &\le\frac{2}{15}q(\xi)\xi\theta_j^4S_{2,L_j}
       =c_j\delta_j^{\,E},\\
\delta_j^{\,E}
 &=\frac25q(\xi)\frac{\theta_j^4S_{2,L_j}}{\|z_j\|},\\
j^5\delta_j^{\,E}
 &\longrightarrow\frac{16q(\xi)\pi^2}{5\sqrt5\cdot10^8}.
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{22.23}
\]
The last limit follows from the same exact sums as (22.15):
\(\theta_j^4S_{2,L_j}/\|z_j\|\), multiplied by \(j^5\),
tends to \(8\pi^2/(\sqrt5\cdot10^8)\).
Thus the retained finite-angle correction is of higher order
than the full product comparison.

Here nonvanishing of \(v_j\) can also be checked quantitatively.
Under the period thresholds used in (22.17), \(\theta_jL_j<1\).
Termwise Taylor bounds imply
\(\|z_j\|\ge(\theta_j^2/3)\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|\).
Also
\(S_{2,L}/\|\mathsf Iw^{\rm nat}\|
\le\sqrt{S_{2,L}/2}\le3L^{7/2}\).
Consequently
\[
\delta_j^{\,E}\le
\frac{18}{5}q(\xi)\theta_j^2L_j^{7/2}
\le\frac{129024}{5\cdot10^8}j^{-5}<\frac14.
\]
Combining this with
\(\|\mathcal U_j\|\ge c_j\sqrt{1-b_C}\) proves
\(\|\mathcal Z_j\|\ge c_j/2>0\).
Thus \(v_j\ne0\) at the same explicit eventual threshold,
with its original amplitude retained.

Set
\[
\Theta_j^{\,E}
 =(\varepsilon_j+\delta_j^{\,E})
     \bigl(2\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)}+\varepsilon_j+3\delta_j^{\,E}\bigr).
\]
The exact difference
\(\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal Z_j
 =(\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal U_j)
       -(\mathcal U_j-\mathcal Z_j)\)
has norm at most \(c_j(\varepsilon_j+\delta_j^{\,E})\).
Apply the three-term expansion from (22.19), now with
\(\|\mathcal Z_j\|\le
c_j(\sqrt{1+b_C}+\delta_j^{\,E})\), to obtain
\[
\left|\int f\,d\eta_{\chi,j}-\int f\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}\right|
 \le c_j^2\Theta_j^{\,E},\qquad |f|\le1 .
                                                               \tag{22.24}
\]
This includes the difference of the two raw total masses.
In the actual spectral-probability fractions the coefficient is
retained in both numerator and denominator:
\[
\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}=\frac49\theta_j^4\eta_{v,j},\qquad
C_{\mathcal Z,j}=\frac49\theta_j^4C_{v,j},\qquad
\mu_{\mathcal Z,j}=\mu_{v,j}.
\]
The equality of the fractions follows from these exact two
identities and their already proved positive denominators; it does
not set the original vector amplitude to one. The proof of (22.20)
therefore gives the complete original-state comparison
\[
\boxed{\ 
\|\mu_{\chi,j}-\mu_{v,j}\|_{\rm TV}
 \le8\Theta_j^{\,E}\longrightarrow0 .
\ }                                                            \tag{22.25}
\]
The Hamiltonian, its spectral projections, original physical units,
fixed positive coupling, raw native \(n_2^2\) weights and original
cusp sequence are the same on both sides. This is not an assertion
that the electric-state spectral probabilities themselves have a
continuum limit.

## 22.7. Sources, scope, and the next energy calculation

The original finite-graph Haar and invariant Hilbert decomposition is
the Baez source cited in Section21.1; its retained TeX174--321 was
reread for this calculation. The tensor-product splitting has been
proved here in polynomial coordinates, including its inverse and
kernel, rather than inferred from a name or a routed literature hit.
The canonical index was also queried for Clebsch--Gordan material;
the returned adjacent books were not used as unread theorem evidence.
The higher electric moments come from the full local resolvent and
score proofs in Sections2,3,10,13 and21. The covariance estimate
used for the nonzero denominator is (20.12), with its original
Nachtergaele--Sims primary-source dependencies and complete
Sections13--17 proof. The original period input is the complete
used Section2/2.1 of the companion source cited in Section20.7.

The previously unresolved whole-product *norm* remainder is now
controlled on the unchanged cusp, with a proved denominator and
complete bounded spectral-measure comparison at fixed
\(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\). The generic comparison (22.12) remains valid
at every positive coupling. No claim that its denominator estimate
extends to all such couplings is made.
Bounds for all bounded spectral tests do not themselves bound an
unbounded first energy moment. Section23 supplies a separate full
\(A_j^{1/2}\)-form calculation and an energy-weighted comparison.
Section23.8 also proves that the individual first-energy tails are
not uniformly integrable on this fixed-coupling sequence. Coupling
continuation and the spatial continuum construction remain unfinished;
neither the Millennium mass gap nor its negation follows from
(22.20) alone.

# 23. Full-product energy form and first-energy-weighted spectral comparison

Retain the complete finite box, Hilbert space, physical gauge restriction
and Hamiltonian (1.1)--(1.3). Put \(H_0=\sum_eE_e\),
\(A=H-\mathcal E\), where \(H\psi=\mathcal E\psi\), and
\(q_A[x]=\|A^{1/2}x\|^2\). The vacuum is the same smooth positive
unit vector as in Section1. Assign an arbitrary real angle \(s_e\) to
every link, permitting zero angles on all unused links, and retain
\[
C_e=C_{e,s_e},\quad J_e=I-C_e,\quad
S=\sum_eJ_e,\quad K=\prod_eC_e,\quad
t_e=1-\cos s_e,\quad T_1=\sum_et_e,\quad z=\mathsf It.
\tag{23.1}
\]
Thus \(z_p=\sum_{e\in p}t_e\ge0\). The incidence matrix is the
original unsigned face incidence, not a replacement graph.
Set \(\mathcal U=Q_\psi S\psi\) and \(\chi=Q_\psi K\psi\).
All products below include the negative \(C_e\) multipliers.

## 23.1. Joint moments needed by the complete product

The first, second and mixed electric estimates already proved give,
for every \(\xi>0\),
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|E_e\psi\|&\le8\xi,&
\|E_e^2\psi\|&\le6\xi+128\xi^2,\\
\|E_eE_f\psi\|&\le3\xi+96\xi^2\quad(e\ne f).
\end{aligned}\tag{23.2}
\]
For the last inequality use the middle bound in (20.15), not its
last small-coupling bound \(4\xi\). Its proof used the full local
comparison, score estimate and product rule, all valid for every
positive \(\xi\). Define
\[
B_1(\xi)=\xi(14+128\xi),\qquad
p(\xi)=1+22\xi+128\xi^2.
\]
For all links \(e,f\), including \(e=f\), the triangle inequality
applied to the full expansions proves
\[
\|(E_e+I)E_f\psi\|\le B_1(\xi),\qquad
\|(E_e+I)(E_f+I)\psi\|\le p(\xi).
\tag{23.3}
\]
For distinct links the actual bounds before enlargement are
\(11\xi+96\xi^2\) and \(1+19\xi+96\xi^2\).
For equal links they are \(14\xi+128\xi^2\) and
\(1+22\xi+128\xi^2\). This explicitly accounts for the diagonal.
All these operators commute in the original joint electric resolution.
The all-angle inequality \(0\le J_f\le(4/3)t_fE_f\), proved in
(20.1), therefore also gives
\[
\|(E_e+I)S\psi\|
 \le\frac43 B_1(\xi)T_1 .
\tag{23.4}
\]
Indeed square the scalar multiplier inequality on each joint block
for each summand, sum its squared action on \(\psi\), and then use
the triangle inequality over \(f\). No independence of vacuum
marginals and no spectral gap are used in (23.2)--(23.4).

## 23.2. The sixteen full plaquette bands and their exact commutators

For a face \(p\), order its four distinct physical links and write
\(\boldsymbol n=(n_e)_{e\in p}\in\mathbb N_0^4\),
where \(n_e=2j_e\) and \(\lambda_n=n(n+2)/4\).
Let \(P_{\boldsymbol n}^{p}=\prod_{e\in p}P_{n_e}^{(e)}\), with
the exterior identity retained. For
\(\sigma\in\{-1,1\}^4\) define
\[
W_p^\sigma
 =\sum_{\substack{\boldsymbol n\in\mathbb N_0^4\\
                  \boldsymbol n+\sigma\in\mathbb N_0^4}}
 P_{\boldsymbol n+\sigma}^{p}\,W_p\,P_{\boldsymbol n}^{p}.
\tag{23.5}
\]
The source polynomial splitting (22.1)--(22.3), applied separately
to each of the four matrix-coefficient factors in \(W_p\), proves
\(W_p=\sum_{\sigma\in\{-1,1\}^4}W_p^\sigma\).
Inverse occurrences of links remain fundamental coefficients by the
explicit adjugate formula in Section22.1. For fixed \(\sigma\),
distinct input labels have distinct orthogonal output blocks.
For a finite block vector \(v\),
\[
\|W_p^\sigma v\|^2
\le\|W_p\|_\infty^2\sum_{\boldsymbol n}
                  \|P_{\boldsymbol n}^{p}v\|^2
\le4\|v\|^2 .
\]
This proves the strong extension and \(\|W_p^\sigma\|\le2\).
Invalid input or output labels give the zero operator. The bands
are not claimed invertible. Each electric projection and \(W_p\)
commutes with the vertex gauge action, so each band preserves the
physical subspace, including every boundary constraint.

Let \(F\) be any bounded real function of the joint electric labels,
with scalar value \(f(\boldsymbol n,\boldsymbol n_{\rm out})\).
Define \(D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma}\) to multiply a valid input block by
\(f(\boldsymbol n+\sigma,\boldsymbol n_{\rm out})
-f(\boldsymbol n,\boldsymbol n_{\rm out})\), and zero on invalid
inputs. Define \(D^{\rm out}_{p,\sigma}\) on a valid output block
\(\boldsymbol m\) by
\(f(\boldsymbol m,\boldsymbol n_{\rm out})
-f(\boldsymbol m-\sigma,\boldsymbol n_{\rm out})\), and zero
otherwise. These are real diagonal operators. Direct multiplication
of each input-output block proves the exact identities
\[
\begin{aligned}
{}[F,W_p^\sigma]
 &=W_p^\sigma D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma}
   =D^{\rm out}_{p,\sigma}W_p^\sigma,\\
[F,[F,W_p^\sigma]]
 &=W_p^\sigma(D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma})^2
   =D^{\rm out}_{p,\sigma}W_p^\sigma D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma}.
\end{aligned}\tag{23.6}
\]
All exterior labels and matrix-coefficient multiplicities are
unchanged. The same difference estimate on a reverse shift
\(-\sigma\) bounds the output multiplier on \(\psi\); one does not
replace its vacuum distribution by the input distribution.

## 23.3. Complete signed-product difference on one plaquette

Use specifically \(F=K-I+S\), so that
\(Q_\psi F\psi=\chi+\mathcal U\). On a joint block write
\(c_e=c_{n_e/2}(s_e)\) and, for the shifted face labels,
\(c'_e=c_{(n_e+\sigma_e)/2}(s_e)\).
Put \(K_{\rm out}=\prod_{e\notin p}c_e\) and
\(S_{\rm out}=\sum_{e\notin p}(1-c_e)\).
In the chosen face order the full product difference is exactly
\[
\Delta f
 =\sum_{e\in p}(c'_e-c_e)
   \left[
     K_{\rm out}\prod_{\substack{f\in p\\f<e}}c'_f
                   \prod_{\substack{f\in p\\f>e}}c_f-1
   \right].
\tag{23.7}
\]
To verify it, telescope \(K_{\rm out}(\prod c'_e-\prod c_e)\);
the change of \(S\) is exactly \(-\sum_{e\in p}(c'_e-c_e)\).
This proves (23.7) including every mixed term.

All \(c_e,c'_e\) lie in \([-1,1]\). For real contractions \(a_i\),
telescoping gives
\(\left|1-\prod_i a_i\right|\le\sum_i(1-a_i)\):
the absolute value of each prefix product is at most one and
\(1-a_i\ge0\). This proof requires no positive-product restriction.
The one-link Casimir inequalities from Section22.1 imply
\[
\begin{aligned}
|c'_e-c_e|
 &\le\frac43t_e(\lambda_{n_e+\sigma_e}+\lambda_{n_e})
 \le4t_e(\lambda_{n_e}+1),\\
\left|
K_{\rm out}\prod_{f<e}c'_f\prod_{f>e}c_f-1
\right|
 &\le S_{\rm out}
     +\frac83\sum_{\substack{f\in p\\f\ne e}}
                 t_f(\lambda_{n_f}+1).
\end{aligned}\tag{23.8}
\]
For the first line,
\(\lambda_{n+\sigma}\le2(\lambda_n+1)\) and
\(\lambda_n+\lambda_{n+\sigma}\le3(\lambda_n+1)\).
For the second, an unshifted \(1-c_f\) is at most
\((4/3)t_f\lambda_{n_f}\), and a shifted one is at most
\((8/3)t_f(\lambda_{n_f}+1)\). The negative label is never introduced.

Retain the ordered off-diagonal face sum
\[
\omega_p=\sum_{\substack{e,f\in p\\e\ne f}}t_et_f
         =z_p^2-\sum_{e\in p}t_e^2 .
\]
Multiplying the pointwise nonnegative majorants in (23.8),
using (23.3)--(23.4) on the original \(\psi\), and taking the
triangle inequality proves both bounds
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma}\psi\|,\ 
\|D^{\rm out}_{p,\sigma}\psi\|
 &\le B_p,\\
B_p&=\frac{16}{3}B_1(\xi)T_1z_p
                 +\frac{32}{3}p(\xi)\omega_p .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.9}
\]
For example the exterior term for link \(e\) contributes at most
\(4t_e(4/3)B_1T_1\); an ordered distinct face pair contributes
\(4t_e(8/3)t_fp\). This verifies every coefficient in (23.9).
For the output multiplier apply the same proof with \(-\sigma\)
and regard its output label as the new unshifted label.

## 23.4. Exact full-Hamiltonian energy identity and volume estimate

Every bounded real electric multiplier preserves
\(\operatorname{Dom}H_0\), commutes with \(H_0\), and preserves
\(\operatorname{Dom}H=\operatorname{Dom}H_0\).
Consequently the following double commutator identity is valid on
the smooth vacuum; its final commutators are bounded operators:
\[
\begin{aligned}
q_A[Q_\psi F\psi]
 &=\langle F\psi,(H-\mathcal E)F\psi\rangle\\
 &=\frac12\langle\psi,[F,[H,F]]\psi\rangle\\
 &=\frac b2\sum_{p\in\mathsf P_L}
                  \langle\psi,[F,[F,W_p]]\psi\rangle .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.10}
\]
Indeed \([F,[H,F]]=2FHF-F^2H-HF^2\); insertion of
\(H\psi=\mathcal E\psi\) proves the second line.
The full Hamiltonian is \(\kappa H_0+2bM-b\sum_pW_p\).
Its electric and scalar terms commute with \(F\), while
\([H,F]=b\sum_p[F,W_p]\). This gives the plus sign \(b/2\)
in the last line without deleting the original \(-bW_p\) term
or changing the energy origin.

Equations (23.6) and (23.9) give
\[
|\langle\psi,[F,[F,W_p^\sigma]]\psi\rangle|
 \le2\|D^{\rm out}_{p,\sigma}\psi\|
       \|D^{\rm in}_{p,\sigma}\psi\|\le2B_p^2.
\]
There are sixteen signs. Thus, with
\(z_{\max}=\max_{p\in\mathsf P_L}z_p\),
\[
\begin{aligned}
q_A[\chi+\mathcal U]
 &\le16b\sum_p B_p^2\\
 &\le16b\|z\|^2
 \left[\frac{16}{3}B_1(\xi)T_1
                 +\frac{32}{3}p(\xi)z_{\max}\right]^2 .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.11}
\]
The second inequality uses only
\(0\le\omega_p\le z_p^2\le z_{\max}z_p\).
In particular it does not cost a factor equal to the number of faces.

For \(t\ne0\) every link belongs to at least one face, whence
\(\|z\|>0\). Retain the original coefficient
\(c_s=\xi\|z\|/3\) and define
\[
\begin{aligned}
\eta_F
 &=64\sqrt{\xi}(14+128\xi)T_1
       +\frac{128p(\xi)}{\sqrt{\xi}}z_{\max},\\
\|A^{1/2}(\chi+\mathcal U)\|
 &\le\sqrt{\kappa}\,c_s\eta_F .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.12}
\]
Taking the square root of (23.11), inserting \(b=\kappa\xi\),
and dividing the bound by \(\sqrt\kappa c_s\) proves this formula.
No vector is divided by a norm. When \(t=0\), (20.1) gives
\(J_e=0\) for every link, so the un-divided statement is the
identity \(\chi=\mathcal U=0\). All statements (23.1)--(23.12)
hold at every positive coupling.

## 23.5. Form-domain map back to the unchanged electric weights

Define the real diagonal remainder from (22.22),
\[
h_e(n)=1-c_{n/2}(s_e)-\frac23s_e^2\lambda_n,\qquad
G=\sum_eh_e(E_e),
\]
where \(h_e(E_e)\) denotes its value \(h_e(n)\) on label \(n\),
not substitution of \(\lambda_n\) for the label.
To avoid any bounded-commutator assumption for this unbounded
operator, first take the actual electric cutoff
\[
h_{e,\Lambda}(n)=h_e(n)\mathbf1_{\{\lambda_n\le\Lambda\}},
\qquad G_\Lambda=\sum_eh_{e,\Lambda}(E_e).
\]
The cutoff is auxiliary to this proof only. The absolute remainder
bound \(|h_e(n)|\le(2/15)s_e^4\lambda_n^2\) proves, including
a jump across the cutoff,
\[
|h_{e,\Lambda}(n+\sigma)-h_{e,\Lambda}(n)|
 \le\frac{2}{15}s_e^4(\lambda_{n+\sigma}^2+\lambda_n^2)
 \le\frac23s_e^4(\lambda_n+1)^2 .
\tag{23.13}
\]
There is no differentiation of a discontinuous cutoff. The last
coefficient follows from
\(\lambda_{n+\sigma}^2+\lambda_n^2
\le5(\lambda_n+1)^2\).
Consequently the input and output differences for \(G_\Lambda\)
on every band have vacuum norm at most
\((2/3)p(\xi)\sum_{e\in p}s_e^4\), by (23.3) with \(e=f\).
The bounded identity (23.10) and all sixteen bands now give
\[
q_A[Q_\psi G_\Lambda\psi]
 \le\frac{64}{9}b\,p(\xi)^2\|\mathsf I(s^4)\|^2 .
\tag{23.14}
\]
Here \((s^4)_e=s_e^4\); the complete face norm, rather than a
maximum over a selected subset of faces, is retained.

The limit \(\Lambda\to\infty\) is a form-domain limit at each
original finite box. To prove it, put \(h_0=\sum_e\lambda_{n_e}\)
on a joint block. The bound
\[
\left|\sum_e h_{e,\Lambda}(n_e)\right|
\le\frac{2}{15}\left(\max_e s_e^4\right)h_0^2
\]
is uniform in \(\Lambda\). The smooth vacuum belongs to
\(\operatorname{Dom}H_0^k\) for every integer \(k\).
Dominated summation with weight \(1+h_0\) therefore proves
\(G_\Lambda\psi\to G\psi\) in the \(H_0^{1/2}\) graph norm.
Since \(H-\kappa H_0\) is bounded at this fixed box, that graph
norm and the \(A^{1/2}\) graph norm are equivalent. Centering
subtracts a multiple of \(\psi\) and is continuous in both.
Passing to the limit in (23.14) proves
\[
\|A^{1/2}Q_\psi G\psi\|
 \le\frac83\sqrt b\,p(\xi)\|\mathsf I(s^4)\|.
\tag{23.15}
\]
No uniform cutoff convergence was presumed; the uniform final
bound follows from (23.14), whose right side has no cutoff.

On the native angles \(s_{(n,1)}=\theta n_2\), zero on the other
directions, retain \(v=Q_\psi\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2E_e\psi\) and
\(\mathcal Z=(2/3)\theta^2v\). The exact identity and bound are
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal U-\mathcal Z&=Q_\psi G\psi,\\
\eta_G&=\frac{8p(\xi)}{\sqrt\xi}\,
                 \frac{\|\mathsf I(s^4)\|}{\|\mathsf It\|},\\
\|A^{1/2}(\mathcal U-\mathcal Z)\|
 &\le\sqrt\kappa\,c_s\eta_G .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.16}
\]
Thus the electric state and the full product are connected by
the proved form-domain difference, not only by a formal series.

## 23.6. The same cusp: exact bound and its physical scale

Use exactly (20.21):
\(L_j=j^2,\ a_j=1/(100j),\
\theta_j=2\pi/(10^4j^2D_j)\), with
\(D_j=L_{j^2}q_{j^2}+6m_{j^2}^2\) retained. Coupling \(g_{\rm YM}\)
is fixed and positive, and
\(\kappa_j=200g_{\rm YM}^2j\).
For the period thresholds in Section22.4, \(\theta_jL_j<1\).
Every face has at most two direction-one links, so
\[
z_{\max,j}\le2\max_e t_e\le\theta_j^2L_j^2.
\]
For \(w^{\rm nat}_e=n_2^2\) on the direction-one links,
\((w^{\rm nat}_e)^2\le L_j^2w^{\rm nat}_e\).
Every entry of \(\mathsf I\) is nonnegative. The termwise
bound \(1-\cos(\theta_jn_2)\ge\theta_j^2n_2^2/3\)
therefore gives
\[
\frac{\|\mathsf I(s^4)\|}{\|\mathsf It\|}
 \le3\theta_j^2L_j^2,\qquad
\eta_{G,j}\le\frac{24p(\xi)}{\sqrt\xi}\theta_j^2L_j^2.
\tag{23.17}
\]
The numerator before this inequality is
\(\theta_j^4\|\mathsf I((w^{\rm nat})^2)\|\); the denominator
is the original finite-angle incidence norm.

Set
\[
\eta_j=\eta_{F,j}+\eta_{G,j},\qquad
r_j=\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal Z_j.
\]
Combining the exact identity
\(r_j=(\chi_{\theta_j}+\mathcal U_j)
       -(\mathcal U_j-\mathcal Z_j)\)
with (23.12) and (23.16) proves
\[
\boxed{\ \|A_j^{1/2}r_j\|\le\sqrt{\kappa_j}\,c_j\eta_j.\ }
\tag{23.18}
\]
This estimate is valid at every fixed \(\xi>0\). The original
finite sums (22.15) and the period expansion
\(\theta_j^2L_j^2=O(j^{-8})\) give
\[
\begin{aligned}
\eta_{G,j}&=O_\xi(j^{-8}),\\
j^2\eta_j&\longrightarrow
\frac{1024\pi^2\sqrt\xi(14+128\xi)}{3\cdot10^8}.
\end{aligned}\tag{23.19}
\]
Both terms of \(\eta_F\) and the entire \(\eta_G\) were bounded
before taking this limit. In particular no faster diagonal
sequence or rescaled Hamiltonian was substituted.

Now restrict to \(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\), the already proved
denominator and covariance interval. The independent physical
gap (15.13) gives
\(\gamma_\xi=3(1-512\xi/3)>0\) and
\(A_j\ge\kappa_j\gamma_\xi\) on the physical vacuum complement.
The vector \(r_j\) lies there, since all of its factors preserve
gauge invariance and it is centered. Hence
\[
\|r_j\|\le c_j\epsilon_j^{\,\mathrm{en}},\qquad
\epsilon_j^{\,\mathrm{en}}=\eta_j/\sqrt{\gamma_\xi}
                         =O_\xi(j^{-2}).
\tag{23.20}
\]
This improves the earlier norm rate by a separate energy proof;
it is not used circularly to prove the physical gap.
At the explicit dyadic threshold of (22.18) retain
\(\|\chi_{\theta_j}\|\ge c_j/2\) and
\(\|\mathcal Z_j\|\ge c_j/2\), already proved independently.

## 23.7. Raw measures, mass fractions and the unbounded energy test

For \(X=\chi_{\theta_j}\) or \(\mathcal Z_j\), retain
\[
\eta_{X,j}(B)=\langle X,P_{A_j}(B)X\rangle,\quad
C_{X,j}=\|X\|^2,\quad \mu_{X,j}=\eta_{X,j}/C_{X,j}.
\]
The scalar notation \(\eta_j\) in (23.18) is an error coefficient;
the notation \(\eta_{X,j}\) here is a measure and carries its
vector index. No raw vector or its amplitude is changed.
Define, using the already proved \(b_C,b_N,\delta_j^{\,E}\),
\[
\begin{aligned}
B_{Z,j}&=\sqrt{1+b_C(\xi)}+\delta_j^{\,E},\\
A_{Z,j}&=\sqrt{3+b_N(\xi)}+\eta_{G,j},\\
d_{C,j}&=\epsilon_j^{\,\mathrm{en}}
                      (2B_{Z,j}+\epsilon_j^{\,\mathrm{en}}),\\
d_{N,j}&=\eta_j(2A_{Z,j}+\eta_j).
\end{aligned}\tag{23.21}
\]
By (22.23), \(\|\mathcal Z_j\|\le c_jB_{Z,j}\).
By (20.12) and (23.16),
\(\|A_j^{1/2}\mathcal Z_j\|\le
\sqrt{\kappa_j}c_jA_{Z,j}\).
The two upper coefficients stay bounded at fixed \(\xi\).

For any complex Borel function with \(|f|\le1\), use
\(\chi_{\theta_j}=-\mathcal Z_j+r_j\).
Expand the quadratic expressions into the two cross terms and
the \(r_j\) term and apply the operator bound \(\|f(A_j)\|\le1\).
The same expansion on
\(A_j^{1/2}\chi_{\theta_j}
=-A_j^{1/2}\mathcal Z_j+A_j^{1/2}r_j\) gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\left|\int f\,d\eta_{\chi,j}-\int f\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}\right|
 &\le c_j^2d_{C,j},\\
\left|\int \lambda f(\lambda)\,d\eta_{\chi,j}
             -\int \lambda f(\lambda)\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}\right|
 &\le\kappa_jc_j^2d_{N,j}.
\end{aligned}\tag{23.22}
\]
The second integrals are finite since the vectors lie in
\(\operatorname{Dom}A_j^{1/2}\). The spectral theorem identifies
them with the corresponding bounded-\(f\) quadratic forms of
the \(A_j^{1/2}\) vectors. This is a new estimate for the
unbounded energy weight, not an inference from (22.25).
The first line with \(f=1\) also bounds the difference of the
two actual masses by \(c_j^2d_{C,j}\).

To check the division explicitly, for any integrand \(g\) write
\[
\frac{\int g\,d\eta_{\chi,j}}{C_{\chi,j}}
-\frac{\int g\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}}{C_{\mathcal Z,j}}
=\frac{\int g\,d(\eta_{\chi,j}-\eta_{\mathcal Z,j})}{C_{\chi,j}}
+\frac{C_{\mathcal Z,j}-C_{\chi,j}}
        {C_{\chi,j}C_{\mathcal Z,j}}
                \int g\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}.
\tag{23.23}
\]
For \(g=f\), the first term has absolute value at most
\(4d_{C,j}\); the second is also at most \(4d_{C,j}\).
For \(g(\lambda)=\lambda f(\lambda)\), the first is at most
\(4\kappa_jd_{N,j}\). The second is at most
\(16\kappa_jA_{Z,j}^2d_{C,j}\), because
\(\int\lambda\,d\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}\le
\kappa_jc_j^2A_{Z,j}^2\) and both masses are at least \(c_j^2/4\).
The exact earlier identities
\(\eta_{\mathcal Z,j}=(4/9)\theta_j^4\eta_{v,j}\) and
\(C_{\mathcal Z,j}=(4/9)\theta_j^4C_{v,j}\) give
\(\mu_{\mathcal Z,j}=\mu_{v,j}\).
With total variation defined as the supremum over complex Borel
\(|f|\le1\), this proves
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\mu_{\chi,j}-\mu_{v,j}\|_{\rm TV}
 &\le8d_{C,j}=O_\xi(j^{-2}),\\
\|\lambda(\mu_{\chi,j}-\mu_{v,j})\|_{\rm TV}
 &\le\kappa_j(4d_{N,j}+16A_{Z,j}^2d_{C,j})
   =O_{\xi,g_{\rm YM}}(j^{-1})\longrightarrow0 .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.24}
\]
The energy variable is that of the original \(A_j\), not
\(A_j/\kappa_j\). The final rate follows from
\(d_C,d_N=O_\xi(j^{-2})\) and
\(\kappa_j=200g_{\rm YM}^2j\). Thus it remains a vanishing
bound even after the original physical energy factor is restored.

For completeness let \(s\ge0\) be a common spectral cutoff.
Use \(f=\mathbf1_{[s,\infty)}\) in (23.22)--(23.24).
The difference of the two first-energy tails is bounded
uniformly in \(s\) by the second line of (23.24).
This does not bound either individual tail uniformly in \(j\).
The distinction follows directly from (23.23): its left side
is a difference. Section23.8 proves that both individual means
actually diverge on the present fixed-coupling sequence.

There is also a direct observable consequence. Write
\[
\begin{aligned}
\varphi_{X,j}(u)&=\int e^{-iu\lambda}\,d\mu_{X,j}(\lambda),
                  &&u\in\mathbb R,\\
\ell_{X,j}(u)&=\int e^{-u\lambda}\,d\mu_{X,j}(\lambda),
                  &&u\ge0 .
\end{aligned}
\]
Every first energy moment is finite at each fixed \(j\).
Dominated differentiation gives
\(\varphi'=-i\int\lambda e^{-iu\lambda}d\mu\) and
\(\ell'=-\int\lambda e^{-u\lambda}d\mu\), with the right
derivative at zero for \(\ell\). The support is \([0,\infty)\),
so all four bounded test functions have absolute value at most
one before the explicitly retained energy factor. Consequently
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sup_{u\in\mathbb R}|\varphi_{\chi,j}-\varphi_{v,j}|,\
\sup_{u\ge0}|\ell_{\chi,j}-\ell_{v,j}|
 &\le8d_{C,j},\\
\sup_{u\in\mathbb R}|\varphi'_{\chi,j}-\varphi'_{v,j}|,\
\sup_{u\ge0}|\ell'_{\chi,j}-\ell'_{v,j}|
 &\le\kappa_j(4d_{N,j}+16A_{Z,j}^2d_{C,j}).
\end{aligned}\tag{23.25}
\]
In each supremum both functions are evaluated at the same \(u\).
Thus the exact two state families have uniformly close real-time
and Euclidean spectral functions and their first derivatives.
This difference bound alone does not infer an individual limiting
function; the next subsection calculates their fixed-coupling escape.

## 23.8. Exact fixed-coupling spectral escape and failure of uniform tails

The independent physical gap supplies more than a norm bound.
On the original physical vacuum complement,
\(A_j\ge\kappa_j\gamma_\xi\). The spectral theorem on that
reducing subspace therefore gives, for both \(X=\chi_{\theta_j}\)
and \(X=v_j\),
\[
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{supp}\eta_{X,j}
 &\subset[\kappa_j\gamma_\xi,\infty),\\
\mu_{X,j}([0,E])&=0
\quad\hbox{for }\ 
j>\frac{E}{200g_{\rm YM}^2\gamma_\xi},\quad E\ge0 .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.26}
\]
Here \(j\) also exceeds the explicit nonzero-state threshold
of (22.18). To justify the spectral implication directly, a
nonzero vector in a spectral interval lying strictly below
\(\kappa_j\gamma_\xi\) would have Rayleigh value below that
lower bound, a contradiction. The union of such intervals
exhausts \([0,\kappa_j\gamma_\xi)\). The full product and
electric vectors are physical and centered; no component
at the vacuum eigenvalue remains.

Every compactly supported continuous test function on
\([0,\infty)\) has integral zero for all sufficiently large
dyadic \(j\). Thus these probabilities converge vaguely to
the zero measure. They have no weakly convergent probability
subsequence on this unscaled energy half-line. Indeed, any
such weak limit would integrate every compactly supported
continuous test to zero, so would be the zero Radon measure;
weak convergence also tests the constant function one and
would give total mass one. These conclusions are incompatible.
This is a proof about the displayed states at the displayed
fixed coupling, not a change of their measure definition.

The exact lower bound on the individual mean and tail is
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int\lambda\,d\mu_{X,j}(\lambda)
 &\ge200g_{\rm YM}^2\gamma_\xi j,\\
\sup_j\int_{[E,\infty)}\lambda\,d\mu_{X,j}(\lambda)
 &=\infty \qquad\hbox{for every finite }E\ge0 .
\end{aligned}\tag{23.27}
\]
For the second line take arbitrarily large dyadic \(j\) for
which the whole support lies above \(E\), and apply the first
line. In particular neither family of first-energy tails is
uniformly integrable. Their difference nevertheless tends
to zero in the weighted variation norm (23.24). The latter
therefore compares two escaping measures; it is not a
hidden tightness statement.

For the Euclidean functions at each fixed \(u>0\), (23.26)
also gives the actual individual limit
\[
0\le\ell_{X,j}(u)
 \le e^{-200g_{\rm YM}^2\gamma_\xi ju}\longrightarrow0,
\qquad \ell_{X,j}(0)=1 .
\tag{23.28}
\]
This pointwise limit is discontinuous at zero and hence is
not the Laplace transform of any probability measure on
the unscaled nonnegative energy half-line. A probability
Laplace transform is continuous at zero by dominated
convergence applied to \(e^{-u\lambda}\). No analogous
pointwise real-time limit is asserted. The actual
four-dimensional continuum programme must still calculate
the original interacting theory's coupling/scale continuation;
(23.26)--(23.28) establish precisely what the present
fixed-coupling state sequence does.

## 23.9. Human sources and the remaining continuum mathematics

The Hilbert decomposition used in (23.5) is John C. Baez,
*Spin Network States in Gauge Theory*, Advances in Mathematics
117 (1996), 253--272, arXiv:gr-qc/9411007v1, Section2,
Lemmas1--3; the retained author TeX174--321 was read in full
for this continuation. Section15 gives the exact inverse-link
map from his vertex-action convention to the present one.
The polynomial maps, kernels and inverses in Section22.1 give
the four-link selection rule in (23.5). The sixteen-band norm,
double commutator, full product difference, form-domain limit
and all new constants are proved above, not imported from a
similarly named result. The canonical literature index was
queried for double-commutator sources; its adjacent Kubo and
Yang--Mills routing hits were not treated as read theorem evidence.
The inherited covariance and physical-gap estimates retain
their original primary-source crosswalks in Sections13--17.

The original-product energy-form comparison is now proved,
including the first-energy-weighted variation difference in
unscaled physical units. Its nonzero-denominator and
probability conclusions are at fixed \(0<\xi\le10^{-16}\);
the un-divided form estimates hold at every \(\xi>0\).
The same fixed-coupling physical gap proves failure of individual
first-energy uniform integrability and escape from every finite
energy interval. This does not extend the coupling range of that
gap, construct a spatial continuum theory under coupling/scale
continuation, or decide the four-dimensional Millennium conclusion.
Those remaining tasks require further mathematics beyond the
complete comparisons and fixed-coupling escape proved here.

Section24 continues the un-divided energy calculation on the original
logarithmic and fixed-electric-coefficient coupling paths. Its
positive-energy transport theorem does not use the fixed-coupling gap.

# 24. The original logarithmic coupling path: energy-weighted spectral transport

Section23.8 concerned fixed coupling in its stated interval. Here the
coupling varies along the already specified logarithmic and
fixed-electric-coefficient paths. The full positive-coupling vacuum
and all physical coefficients are retained. No small-\(\xi\) gap,
weak-coupling covariance denominator, or faster cusp is used.

## 24.1. A full electric-state energy bound at every positive coupling

For the original real angles define the nonnegative electric multiplier
\[
\mathsf L_s=\frac23\sum_es_e^2E_e,\qquad
\mathcal Z_s=Q_\psi\mathsf L_s\psi .
\tag{24.1}
\]
On native angles this is exactly
\(\mathcal Z_s=(2/3)\theta^2v_{w^{\rm nat}}\), including its raw
coefficient. On a single valid spin shift, the original Casimir obeys
\[
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{n+1}-\lambda_n&=(2n+3)/4,\\
\lambda_{n-1}-\lambda_n&=-(2n+1)/4\quad(n\ge1),\\
|\lambda_{n+\sigma}-\lambda_n|&\le\lambda_n+1 .
\end{aligned}\tag{24.2}
\]
For the plus sign the difference between the upper bound and the
left side is \((n^2+1)/4\); for the minus sign it is
\((n^2+3)/4\). Both are nonnegative, including \(n=0\) in the
valid plus case.

Use the auxiliary bounded multiplier
\(\mathsf L_{s,\Lambda}=(2/3)\sum_es_e^2\min(E_e,\Lambda)\),
where the minimum is spectral calculus. The function
\(x\mapsto\min(x,\Lambda)\) is increasing and 1-Lipschitz on
\([0,\infty)\), so its neighboring difference is bounded by
the absolute Casimir difference in (24.2), even across the cutoff.
In each of the sixteen exact plaquette bands of (23.5), both the
input and output difference applied to \(\psi\) therefore have norm
at most
\[
\frac23\sum_{e\in p}s_e^2\|(E_e+I)\psi\|
\le\frac23(1+8\xi)\sum_{e\in p}s_e^2 .
\]
The first electric moment (23.2) proves the last step for every
\(\xi>0\). The complete band identity and double commutator
(23.6), (23.10) give
\[
q_A[Q_\psi\mathsf L_{s,\Lambda}\psi]
 \le\frac{64}{9}b(1+8\xi)^2\|\mathsf I(s^2)\|^2 .
\tag{24.3}
\]
The coefficient is exactly \(16(2/3)^2\), before substituting
any physical parameter. Every face is present in the incidence norm.

For each fixed box,
\(\mathsf L_{s,\Lambda}\psi\to\mathsf L_s\psi\) in the
\(H_0^{1/2}\) graph norm: on a joint label the multipliers
are bounded by \((2/3)(\max_es_e^2)h_0\), where
\(h_0=\sum_e\lambda_{n_e}\), and converge pointwise.
Smoothness of \(\psi\) permits dominated summation with weight
\(1+h_0\). The same bounded-potential and centering argument as
in Section23.5 transfers this to the \(A^{1/2}\) graph norm.
Passing to the limit proves the actual, uncut bound
\[
\|A^{1/2}\mathcal Z_s\|
 \le\frac83\sqrt b(1+8\xi)\|\mathsf I(s^2)\|.
\tag{24.4}
\]
There is no assumption that \(\mathsf L_s\) is bounded and no
cutoff state is substituted for \(\mathcal Z_s\).

For \(t_e=1-\cos s_e\) not identically zero, retain
\(c_s=\xi\|\mathsf It\|/3>0\), and put
\[
\begin{aligned}
R_{2,s}&=\frac{\|\mathsf I(s^2)\|}{\|\mathsf It\|},\\
a_s^{\rm el}&=\frac{8(1+8\xi)}{\sqrt\xi}R_{2,s}.
\end{aligned}\tag{24.5}
\]
Thus (24.4) is
\(\|A^{1/2}\mathcal Z_s\|\le\sqrt\kappa c_s a_s^{\rm el}\).
This is a coefficient-relative estimate, not a probability
denominator or a change of the electric vector's amplitude.
If all \(t_e=0\), use (24.4) without division; angles that are
nonzero multiples of \(2\pi\) can have \(\mathcal Z_s\ne0\).
No assertion of \(\mathcal Z_s=0\) is made at those exceptional angles.

## 24.2. Energy-weighted raw measures without a spectral-gap assumption

The full product is still \(K_s=\prod_eC_{e,s_e}\) and
\(\chi_s=Q_\psi K_s\psi\). Define the all-angle form coefficients
from Section23 without a fixed-coupling asymptotic replacement:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\eta_{F,s}
 &=64\sqrt\xi(14+128\xi)T_1
                 +\frac{128p(\xi)}{\sqrt\xi}z_{\max},\\
\eta_{G,s}
 &=\frac{8p(\xi)}{\sqrt\xi}
                      \frac{\|\mathsf I(s^4)\|}{\|\mathsf It\|},\\
\eta_s&=\eta_{F,s}+\eta_{G,s},\qquad
\mathscr D_s=\kappa\eta_s(2a_s^{\rm el}+\eta_s).
\end{aligned}\tag{24.6}
\]
The un-divided estimates (23.12), (23.15) apply to all real
angles, and the exact identity
\[
\chi_s+\mathcal Z_s
 =(\chi_s+\mathcal U_s)-(\mathcal U_s-\mathcal Z_s)
\]
has the same diagonal remainder \(G\) from Section23.5.
Consequently, for every \(\xi>0\),
\[
\|A^{1/2}(\chi_s+\mathcal Z_s)\|
\le\sqrt\kappa c_s\eta_s .
\tag{24.7}
\]
The source of the possible negative product factors has not
been removed; (23.7) kept them in every prefix product.

For any vector \(X\) here define its raw spectral measure
\(\eta_X(B)=\langle X,P_A(B)X\rangle\).
It is finite and has finite first moment. Put
\(\Delta_s=\eta_{\chi_s}-\eta_{\mathcal Z_s}\).
Expand the two quadratic forms of \(f(A)\) on
\(A^{1/2}\chi_s=-A^{1/2}\mathcal Z_s
                   +A^{1/2}(\chi_s+\mathcal Z_s)\).
For every complex Borel \(|f|\le1\), the two cross terms are
bounded by the product of the two norms, and the residual
term by its squared norm. Equations (24.4)--(24.7) give
\[
\boxed{\ 
\|\lambda\Delta_s\|_{\rm TV}
 :=\sup_{|f|\le1}\left|\int\lambda f(\lambda)\,d\Delta_s\right|
 \le c_s^2\mathscr D_s .\ }
\tag{24.8}
\]
Here \(\lambda\) is the physical spectral variable of \(A\),
not of \(A/\kappa\). In native variables the signed measure is
exactly
\[
\Delta_s=\eta_{\chi_s}-\frac49\theta^4\eta_{v_{w^{\rm nat}}}.
\tag{24.9}
\]
Both measures retain their total masses. Neither is divided by
its total mass in (24.8)--(24.9).

For an arbitrary physical threshold \(\epsilon>0\), the
original state difference itself obeys
\[
\|P_A([\epsilon,\infty))(\chi_s+\mathcal Z_s)\|
 \le \frac{\sqrt\kappa c_s\eta_s}{\sqrt\epsilon}.
\tag{24.10}
\]
This follows by integrating
\(\mathbf1_{[\epsilon,\infty)}(\lambda)\le\lambda/\epsilon\)
against the positive raw measure of that difference.
No whole-spectrum gap is used. The phase relation is the
displayed plus sign between the original vectors.

## 24.3. Exact information retained by energy weighting

To specify the measure map precisely, let \(\mathfrak M_1\)
be the complex finite Borel measures \(\rho\) on \([0,\infty)\)
with \(\int\lambda\,d|\rho|<\infty\). The linear map
\[
\mathsf T:\mathfrak M_1\longrightarrow\mathfrak M,\qquad
(\mathsf T\rho)(B)=\int_B\lambda\,d\rho(\lambda)
\tag{24.11}
\]
takes values in finite complex Borel measures.
It has kernel \(\mathbb C\delta_0\), and its image consists
exactly of measures \(\nu\) with
\[
\nu(\{0\})=0,\qquad
\int_{(0,\infty)}\lambda^{-1}\,d|\nu|(\lambda)<\infty .
\tag{24.12}
\]
To prove the kernel assertion, on every interval
\([\epsilon,R]\), multiplication by \(1/\lambda\) inverts
\(\mathsf T\), so \(\mathsf T\rho=0\) implies that \(\rho\)
is supported at zero. The converse is immediate.
For the image, polar decomposition gives
\(|\lambda\rho|=\lambda|\rho|\) on \((0,\infty)\).
This proves (24.12) for every image measure. Conversely,
for a \(\nu\) satisfying (24.12), set
\[
\rho(B)=\int_{B\cap(0,\infty)}\lambda^{-1}\,d\nu(\lambda)
                         +a\,\mathbf1_B(0),\qquad a\in\mathbb C.
\tag{24.13}
\]
Its total variation is finite by (24.12), its first absolute
moment equals \(|\nu|((0,\infty))\), and \(\mathsf T\rho=\nu\).
This proves the image, the complete fibre of the map and its
inverse on measures having no atom at zero.

On \([\epsilon,\infty)\) the inverse has norm at most
\(1/\epsilon\). Thus (24.8) proves
\[
\|\Delta_s|_{[\epsilon,\infty)}\|_{\rm TV}
 \le\frac{c_s^2\mathscr D_s}{\epsilon}.
\tag{24.14}
\]
There is no inverse bound independent of \(\epsilon\).
For an exact example, the two probabilities
\(\delta_{1/j}\) and \(\delta_{2/j}\) have difference with
total variation \(2\), whereas its image under \(\mathsf T\)
has total variation \(3/j\). They have no atom at zero at
any finite \(j\). This example proves the discontinuity of
the inverse near zero; it is not a replacement model for
the quantum state measures.

The actual finite-box vacuum is simple and the displayed
states are centered, so their measures have no atom at zero.
This gives injectivity of (24.11) for each finite-box measure
here, but no uniform inverse estimate as the box and coupling
vary. Equations (24.10)--(24.14) state exactly which original
positive-energy data are controlled without that estimate.

## 24.4. Original depth and the prescribed logarithmic coupling

Retain the full original dyadic geometric tuple
\[
L_j=j^2,\quad a_j=\frac1{100j},\quad
D_j=L_{j^2}q_{j^2}+6m_{j^2}^2,\quad
\theta_j=\frac{2\pi}{10^4j^2D_j},\quad
s_{(n,1),j}=\theta_jn_2 .
\tag{24.15}
\]
Other direction angles are zero. In particular the cusp
depth remains \(j^2\), not a coupling-dependent larger depth.
The already prescribed logarithmic trajectory is
\[
g_j^2=\frac1{\log j},\qquad
\xi_j=\frac{(\log j)^2}{4},\qquad
\kappa_j=\frac{200j}{\log j},\qquad
b_j=50j\log j,\qquad 2b_jM_j=100jM_j\log j .
\tag{24.16}
\]
All quantities are positive for dyadic \(j\ge2\). Each
\(\psi_j\) is the actual vacuum at these parameters.
In particular \(\xi_j\to\infty\); the small-\(\xi\)
physical-gap theorem does not apply on this trajectory.

The geometric finite sums remain unchanged. Introduce the
explicit coefficient constants
\[
T_*=\frac{16\pi^2}{3\cdot10^8},\qquad
A_*=\frac{16384\pi^2}{3\cdot10^8}.
\]
They are not new physical parameters. From (22.15) and
the all-angle Taylor bounds,
\[
\begin{aligned}
j^2T_{1,j}&\longrightarrow T_*,
&z_{\max,j}&=O(j^{-8}),\\
R_{2,j}&\longrightarrow2,
&\frac{\|\mathsf I(s_j^4)\|}{\|\mathsf It_j\|}
 &\le3\theta_j^2L_j^2=O(j^{-8}).
\end{aligned}\tag{24.17}
\]
For the ratio limit, set \(x=\theta_jn_2\).
The inequality
\(\left|1-\cos x-x^2/2\right|\le x^4/24\) gives
an entrywise relative error at most
\((\theta_jL_j)^2/12\) between \(t_j\) and \(s_j^2/2\),
including equality at zero entries. Since incidence entries
are nonnegative, the same multiplicative bounds hold for
each face coefficient and its Euclidean norm. This proves
\(R_{2,j}\to2\) with no change of weights.

Write \(\ell_j=\log j\) only in the following calculation;
it is not the physical box length used elsewhere.
Substitution of \(\xi_j=\ell_j^2/4\) into every term of
(24.5)--(24.6) gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a_j^{\rm el}}{\ell_j}&\longrightarrow64,\\
\frac{j^2\eta_j}{\ell_j^3}&\longrightarrow A_*,\\
\frac{j\,\mathscr D_j}{\ell_j^3}
 &\longrightarrow25600A_* .
\end{aligned}\tag{24.18}
\]
Here the second limit comes from
\[
64\sqrt{\xi_j}(14+128\xi_j)
       =448\ell_j+1024\ell_j^3.
\]
Multiplication by \(T_{1,j}\) gives the nonzero leading term
\(1024T_*=A_*\). Both remaining terms of \(\eta_j\)
are \(O(\ell_j^3j^{-8})\).
For the first limit,
\[
\frac{8(1+8\xi_j)}{\sqrt{\xi_j}}
 =\frac{16}{\ell_j}+32\ell_j ,
\]
and \(R_{2,j}\to2\).
Finally \(\eta_j/a_j^{\rm el}=O(\ell_j^2j^{-2})\to0\).
Keeping \(\kappa_j=200j/\ell_j\) in
\(\mathscr D_j=\kappa_j\eta_j(2a_j^{\rm el}+\eta_j)\)
proves the third limit, including its coefficient \(25600\).
Polynomial powers of \(\log j\) divided by positive powers
of \(j\) tend to zero: put \(x=\log j\) and bound \(e^{rx}\)
below by any higher integer term of its positive power series.

Consequently the following is a proved weak-coupling result
on the original, unmodified cusp:
\[
\boxed{\ 
\left\|\lambda\left(
\eta_{\chi_j}-\frac49\theta_j^4\eta_{v_j}\right)\right\|_{\rm TV}
\le c_j^2\mathscr D_j,\qquad
\mathscr D_j=O\!\left(\frac{(\log j)^3}{j}\right)\longrightarrow0 .
\ }\tag{24.19}
\]
The coefficient is still \(c_j=\xi_j\|\mathsf It_j\|/3\).
Its exact leading size is
\[
\frac{j^5c_j}{(\log j)^2}
 \longrightarrow\frac{4\pi^2}{3\sqrt5\cdot10^8}.
\tag{24.20}
\]
This follows from the geometric
\(j^5\|\mathsf It_j\|\to16\pi^2/(\sqrt5\cdot10^8)\),
not from treating \(\xi\) as fixed in (22.15).
In particular the raw bound in (24.19) is
\(O((\log j)^7j^{-11})\), and its error relative to the
retained coefficient \(c_j^2\) tends to zero.
No unknown total spectral mass has been used as a denominator.

For any fixed \(\epsilon>0\), (24.10) also yields the actual
positive-energy state comparison with explicit error coefficient
\[
\frac{\|P_{A_j}([\epsilon,\infty))
          (\chi_j+(2/3)\theta_j^2v_j)\|}{c_j}
\le\sqrt{\kappa_j/\epsilon}\,\eta_j
=O_\epsilon\!\left(\frac{(\log j)^{5/2}}{j^{3/2}}\right)
\longrightarrow0 .
\tag{24.21}
\]
This division reports an error relative to an explicit input
coefficient; it does not alter either raw state.
The bound (24.14) similarly controls every Borel spectral
window bounded away from zero, with error
\(c_j^2\mathscr D_j/\epsilon\).

## 24.5. Physical-time differences with the constant term retained

Let \(C_{X,j}=\eta_{X,j}([0,\infty))\), and retain the raw
time functions
\(\Phi_{X,j}(u)=\int e^{-iu\lambda}d\eta_{X,j}\) for real \(u\),
and \(L_{X,j}(u)=\int e^{-u\lambda}d\eta_{X,j}\) for \(u\ge0\).
The first moments are finite at each \(j\), so dominated
differentiation and (24.8) give
\[
\begin{aligned}
\sup_{u\in\mathbb R}|\Phi'_{\chi,j}(u)-\Phi'_{\mathcal Z,j}(u)|
 &\le c_j^2\mathscr D_j,\\
\sup_{u\ge0}|L'_{\chi,j}(u)-L'_{\mathcal Z,j}(u)|
 &\le c_j^2\mathscr D_j .
\end{aligned}\tag{24.22}
\]
At \(u=0\) the derivative in the second line is a right first
derivative. Integrating the first derivatives from zero
retains the unknown constant term exactly:
\[
\begin{aligned}
|(\Phi_{\chi,j}(u)-C_{\chi,j})
       -(\Phi_{\mathcal Z,j}(u)-C_{\mathcal Z,j})|
 &\le |u|c_j^2\mathscr D_j,\\
|(L_{\chi,j}(u)-C_{\chi,j})
       -(L_{\mathcal Z,j}(u)-C_{\mathcal Z,j})|
 &\le u c_j^2\mathscr D_j .
\end{aligned}\tag{24.23}
\]
These inequalities can equivalently be proved using
\(|e^{-iu\lambda}-1|\le|u|\lambda\) and
\(0\le1-e^{-u\lambda}\le u\lambda\).
On (24.16), every bound divided by \(c_j^2\) vanishes,
uniformly on bounded physical-time intervals, and the
derivative bounds are uniform on their whole time domains.
The measures and constants for \(\mathcal Z\) are still
the exact multiples \((4/9)\theta_j^4\) of those for \(v_j\).
No constant term is silently set to zero.

## 24.6. The fixed-electric-coefficient path tested by the same full bound

For the second prescribed trajectory retain (24.15) and
\[
g_j^2=\frac{\kappa_*}{200j},\quad
\xi_j=\frac{10000j^2}{\kappa_*^2},\quad
\kappa_j=\kappa_*,\quad
b_j=\frac{10000j^2}{\kappa_*},\quad
2b_jM_j=\frac{20000j^2M_j}{\kappa_*},\qquad \kappa_*>0.
\tag{24.24}
\]
Define \(\alpha_*=10000/\kappa_*^2\) and
\(F_*=8192\alpha_*^{3/2}T_*\). Direct substitution into
the same bounds, without suppressing the growing magnetic
coefficient, gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a_j^{\rm el}}j&\longrightarrow128\sqrt{\alpha_*},\\
\frac{\eta_j}j&\longrightarrow F_*,\\
\frac{\mathscr D_j}{j^2}
 &\longrightarrow\kappa_*F_*
                (256\sqrt{\alpha_*}+F_*)>0 .
\end{aligned}\tag{24.25}
\]
To check the second limit,
\(64\sqrt{\xi_j}(14+128\xi_j)T_{1,j}/j
\to8192\alpha_*^{3/2}T_*\).
The \(z_{\max}\) and \(s^4\) terms are \(O(j^{-5})\)
before division by \(j\). The first limit follows from
\(R_{2,j}\to2\), and the third retains both terms
of \(\eta_j(2a_j^{\rm el}+\eta_j)\).

Thus (24.8) is still an exact valid bound on this path, but
its coefficient-relative energy error upper bound grows.
This proves failure of this particular estimate to establish
vanishing transport there. It is not a lower bound on the
actual difference and not a proof that the two state
families fail to be related or to converge. No replacement
trajectory is introduced to change that outcome.

## 24.7. Source identities and exact continuation scope

The two parameter tuples are the companion
*Original cusp to spatial quantum continuum*, Section11,
equations(88) and(91), read in their complete containing
section. Only those explicitly displayed parameter choices
are used here; no later selected diagonal, free limit, or
claimed continuum result from that manuscript is imported.
The geometric tuple is its original Section2/2.1, already
retained and pinned in Sections20--23.
The human Hilbert-space source remains Baez, *Spin Network
States in Gauge Theory*, Section2, with the exact inverse-link
convention map in Section15. Its full TeX174--321 was reread.
The canonical index was queried for spectral moments in
lattice gauge theory; the returned routing hits were not
used as content evidence. The Casimir differences, bounded
spectral-cap approximation, band estimates, measure kernel,
inverse and all trajectory coefficients have full proofs
above.

Section24 proves transport of the original positive-energy
raw state and measure data on the prescribed logarithmic
path, including its physical-time derivatives. It does not
derive a covariance denominator, a limiting probability,
a nonzero limiting energy-weighted measure, or a surviving
nonabelian continuum interaction. The finite-box measure
map (24.11)--(24.14) identifies precisely the unresolved
near-zero inverse control. The fixed-electric-coefficient
path remains a distinct unresolved estimate, with the
actual limitation of the present bound proved in (24.25).

# 25. Polynomial conditional anti-concentration and the original weighted covariance

This section replaces the exponential conditional-density estimate used in
Section14 by an exact integration-by-parts estimate on the original
radius-two (SU(2)) link sphere. The Wilson density is not replaced by a
Haar density, a one-plaquette model, or a truncated state. The conditional
density below is the conditional density of the actual positive finite-box
ground state already fixed in Section1. All constants, link coordinates and
the original weight (n_2^2) are retained.

## 25.1. A rank-three sphere estimate

Write a link as

\[
 U=x_0 I+i\sum_{\alpha=1}^3x_\alpha\sigma_\alpha,
 \qquad x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1.
\]

In the metric and differential-operator convention of (1.2), the
coordinate identities are

\[
 \Delta x_\alpha=-\frac34x_\alpha,
 \qquad
 \langle\nabla x_\alpha,\nabla x_\beta\rangle
 =\frac14(\delta_{\alpha\beta}-x_\alpha x_\beta).
 \tag{25.1}
\]

Let $v=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ be any three orthogonal linear coordinates obtained
from $(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)$ by an $O(4)$ change of coordinates. Let $p>0$ be
a smooth probability density on this sphere and suppose

\[
 \|\nabla\log p\|_\infty\le K,
 \qquad K\ge0.
 \tag{25.2}
\]

Put $m=\int v p$, $V=\int|v-m|^2p$, and
\(J=\int\sum_i|\nabla v_i|^2p\). Since the three rows of the differential
of $v$ are orthogonal projections of the four coordinate differentials,

\[
 \sum_i|\nabla v_i|^2=\frac{3-|v|^2}{4}\ge\frac12,
 \qquad \|D v\|_{\rm op}\le\frac12.
 \tag{25.3}
\]

Integrating the divergence of $p(v_i-m_i)\nabla v_i$, summing in $i$,
and using (25.1), gives the identity

\[
 J=\frac34V-
 \int\sum_i(v_i-m_i)\langle\nabla v_i,\nabla\log p\rangle p.
 \tag{25.4}
\]

The last term has absolute value at most $K\sqrt V/2$, by (25.3) and
Cauchy--Schwarz. Hence

\[
 \frac12\le\frac34V+\frac K2\sqrt V.
 \tag{25.5}
\]

Solving this displayed quadratic inequality without changing the sphere or
the density yields

\[
 V\ge \sigma(K),
 \qquad
 \sigma(K)=
 \left(\frac{\sqrt{K^2+6}-K}{3}\right)^2
 =\frac4{(\sqrt{K^2+6}+K)^2}.
 \tag{25.6}
\]

The equality of the two expressions follows from
$(\sqrt{K^2+6}-K)(\sqrt{K^2+6}+K)=6$. In particular, for every fixed
vector $B\in\mathbb R^3$,

\[
 \int|B+v|^2p
 =V+|B+m|^2\ge\sigma(K).
 \tag{25.7}
\]

Thus an exterior-dependent translation cannot cancel the conditional
fluctuation. The explicit elementary lower estimate

\[
 \sigma(K)\ge\frac2{3(1+K)^2}
 \tag{25.8}
\]

follows from
$\sqrt{K^2+6}+K\le\sqrt6(1+K)$. The exact root (25.6), rather than
(25.8), is used below whenever the sharper coefficient matters.

## 25.2. Scalar trace variance on the same sphere

Let $f=2x_0$ after any $O(4)$ change of coordinates. Then

\[
 \Delta f=-\frac34f,
 \qquad |\nabla f|^2=1-\frac{f^2}{4}=|v|^2.
 \tag{25.9}
\]

Writing \(\bar f=\int fp\), \(J_f=\int|\nabla f|^2p\), and
\(V_f=\int(f-\bar f)^2p\), one has $J_f\ge V$. A second integration
by parts gives

\[
 J_f=\frac34V_f-
 \int(f-\bar f)\langle\nabla f,\nabla\log p\rangle p,
 \qquad
 1\le\frac34y^2+Ky,
 \quad y=\sqrt{V_f/J_f}.
 \tag{25.10}
\]

Consequently

\[
 V_f\ge r(K)J_f\ge r(K)\sigma(K),
 \qquad
 r(K)=\left(\frac{2(\sqrt{K^2+3}-K)}3\right)^2
 =\frac4{(\sqrt{K^2+3}+K)^2}.
 \tag{25.11}
\]

The elementary form $r(K)\ge(1+K)^{-2}$ also gives the fully explicit
polynomial estimate

\[
 V_f\ge\frac2{3(1+K)^4}.
 \tag{25.12}
\]

No independence of coordinates has been used in (25.10)--(25.12).

## 25.3. Conditional Wilson gradients in the actual vacuum

Fix an edge $e$ and one incident plaquette $p$. Let $f(e,p)$ be the
unique edge of $p$ parallel to $e$ and opposite to it. Condition on all
link variables except $U_{f(e,p)}$, including $U_e$. The conditional
density is

\[
 p_f(U_f)=\frac{\rho(U_f,U_{\ne f})}
 {\int_{SU(2)}\rho(V,U_{\ne f})\,dV},
 \qquad \rho=\psi^2.
 \tag{25.13}
\]

The denominator is positive because $\psi>0$. The score estimate of
Section10 gives, for every exterior configuration,

\[
 \|\nabla_{f}\log p_f\|_\infty
 =\|\nabla_f\log\rho\|_\infty
 \le4r_f\xi\le16\xi.
 \tag{25.14}
\]

As a function of $U_f$, the plaquette trace is a trace of a fixed product
with $U_f$ or $U_f^{-1}$. Left or right multiplication and inversion are
Haar-preserving orthogonal transformations of the quaternion coordinates.
Differentiating in the fixed $T_a=-i\sigma_a/2$ frame therefore gives,
up to a fixed orthogonal transformation and signs, the three coordinates
\(v_1,v_2,v_3\) of (25.3). In particular the complete derivative is the
rank-three coordinate vector in (25.7); no coefficient is discarded.

All other plaquettes containing $e$ are independent of $U_f$. Thus,
with $B$ their conditional contribution,

\[
 \nabla_e\mathcal W=B+\nabla_eW_p,
 \qquad
 \mathbb E\left[|\nabla_e\mathcal W|^2\mid U_{\ne f}\right]
 \ge\sigma(4r_f\xi)\ge\sigma(16\xi).
 \tag{25.15}
\]

The first inequality is (25.7); the second uses that (25.6) is decreasing
in $K$. Integrating the conditional inequality gives the actual-vacuum
bound

\[
 \mathbb E_\rho|\nabla_e\mathcal W|^2\ge s(\xi),
 \qquad s(\xi)=\sigma(16\xi)>0.
 \tag{25.16}
\]

For the same conditional fibre, $W_p$ is a trace of the form $2x_0$,
so (25.11) and the law of total variance give

\[
 \operatorname{Var}_\rho(W_p)
 \ge r(4r_f\xi)\sigma(4r_f\xi)
 \ge r(16\xi)\sigma(16\xi).
 \tag{25.17}
\]

The form identity (1.5) and the linkwise derivative identity
\(\sum_a|X_{e,a}W_p|^2=1-W_p^2/4\) also yield directly for the
three-link contribution to the full form

\[
 q^{(e)}_{H-\mathcal E}[(W_p-\mathbb E_\rho W_p)\psi]
 =\kappa\,\mathbb E_\rho\sum_{a=1}^3|X_{e,a}W_p|^2
 \ge\kappa\,\sigma(16\xi).
 \tag{25.18}
\]

Here (q^{(e)}) denotes the summand of the full form containing only the
three (T_a)-derivatives on the chosen edge, so that the equality is exact;
the full form is at least this nonnegative summand. This is a positive local
form estimate, not an assertion about a lowest nonzero eigenvalue of the
full Hamiltonian.

## 25.4. Propagation to the original weighted electric covariance

Retain the original operator
\(\Gamma=\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2E_e\), and put
\(v_\Gamma=Q\Gamma\psi\). The exact commutator calculation in the companion
source, with $B_{\rm sk}=[H_0,\mathcal W]$, is

\[
 [\Gamma,H_0]=0,
 \qquad
 \langle[\Gamma,B_{\rm sk}]\rangle_\rho
 =\xi\langle[\mathcal W,[\Gamma,\mathcal W]]\rangle_\rho
 =2\xi S_\Gamma,
 \tag{25.19}
\]

where $S_\Gamma$ is the sum of the squared Wilson derivatives with the
original $n_2^2$ edge weights, with the incident-plaquette contribution
retained. Since $B_{\rm sk}$ is skew-adjoint in the real form used here,

\[
 2\xi S_\Gamma
 =2\operatorname{Re}\langle v_\Gamma,B_{\rm sk}\psi\rangle,
 \qquad
 \|v_\Gamma\|\ge\frac{\xi S_\Gamma}{\|B_{\rm sk}\psi\|}.
 \tag{25.20}
\]

The complete incidence count already proved in the companion calculation
gives

\[
 S_\Gamma\ge\sigma(16\xi)S_{1,L},
 \qquad
 S_{1,L}=\frac23L^2(L+1)(2L+1)^2.
 \tag{25.21}
\]

The electric moment bounds of Sections10 and14 give

\[
 \|B_{\rm sk}\psi\|\le M(6+64\xi),
 \qquad
 M=12L^2(2L+1).
 \tag{25.22}
\]

Combining (25.20)--(25.22), while retaining the exact displayed incidence
ratio, proves for every $L\ge2$ and every $\xi>0$

\[
 \boxed{\displaystyle
 \|v_\Gamma\|\ge
 \frac{\xi\,\sigma(16\xi)\,(L+1)(2L+1)}
 {18(6+64\xi)}>0.}
 \tag{25.23}
\]

This is an actual lower bound for the original weighted electric covariance
vector. It does not divide by, or replace, the reference coefficient
\(c=\xi\|I t\|/3\) used in Sections23--24.

## 25.5. The unchanged logarithmic path

On the original path $L_j=j^2$, $\xi_j=(\log j)^2/4$, the argument of
$\sigma$ in (25.23) is $16\xi_j=4(\log j)^2$. From the exact second
form in (25.6),

\[
 (\log j)^4\sigma(4(\log j)^2)\longrightarrow\frac1{16},
 \qquad
 \frac{\xi_j}{6+64\xi_j}\longrightarrow\frac1{64},
 \qquad
 \frac{(L_j+1)(2L_j+1)}{j^4}
 =2+\frac3{j^2}+\frac1{j^4}\longrightarrow2.
 \tag{25.24}
\]

The factor \(1/18\) remains in (25.23), so the product of the three
limits and that factor is exactly
\[
\frac1{16}\cdot\frac1{64}\cdot\frac2{18}=\frac1{9216}.
\]
Substitution into the unaltered lower bound (25.23) gives the actual
divergence statement

\[
 \boxed{\displaystyle
 \liminf_{j\to\infty}(\log j)^4j^{-4}\,\|v_{\Gamma,j}\|
 \ge\frac1{9216}.}
 \tag{25.25}
\]

and hence \(\|v_{\Gamma,j}\|\to\infty\). The phrase "bounded below by" is
intentional: (25.23) is a lower estimate, not an asymptotic equality for
the covariance.

For the native projected vector $Z_j=(2/3)\theta_j^2v_{\Gamma,j}$, the
same exact original angle gives

\[
 \|Z_j\|\ge\frac23\theta_j^2
 \frac{\xi_j\sigma(16\xi_j)(L_j+1)(2L_j+1)}{18(6+64\xi_j)}.
 \tag{25.26}
\]

Using only the already fixed cusp asymptotic
\(j^6\theta_j\to2\pi/10^4\), (25.26) implies the retained lower-rate
statement

\[
\liminf_{j\to\infty}j^8(\log j)^4\|Z_j\|
 \ge\frac{\pi^2}{3456\,10^8}.
 \tag{25.27}
\]

Because \(\Gamma\) is self-adjoint and \(\langle\psi,Q\Gamma\psi\rangle=0\),
the vector norm in (25.23) is exactly the standard vacuum variance:
\[
 \operatorname{Var}_\rho(\Gamma)
 :=\langle\psi,\Gamma^2\psi\rangle
   -\langle\psi,\Gamma\psi\rangle^2
 =\|Q\Gamma\psi\|^2
 \ge
 \left[
 \frac{\xi\,\sigma(16\xi)(L+1)(2L+1)}
 {18(6+64\xi)}
 \right]^2 .
 \tag{25.28}
\]
For the scalar native projection \(Z=(2/3)\theta^2Q\Gamma\psi\), its
corresponding squared norm is therefore
\[
 \|Z\|^2
 \ge\frac49\theta^4
 \left[
 \frac{\xi\,\sigma(16\xi)(L+1)(2L+1)}
 {18(6+64\xi)}
 \right]^2 .
 \tag{25.29}
\]
On the unchanged logarithmic path, (25.27) equivalently gives the exact
variance-rate statement
\[
 \liminf_{j\to\infty}j^{16}(\log j)^8\|Z_j\|^2
 \ge\frac{\pi^4}{3456^2\,10^{16}} .
 \tag{25.30}
\]
These are lower bounds for the explicitly defined vacuum covariances. They
do not identify either covariance with a spectral gap, and they do not
provide the missing inverse estimate for spectral mass accumulating at
zero.

Equations (25.16)--(25.30) are local finite-volume statements evaluated
on the actual vacuum, followed by an explicit calculation on the prescribed
path. They do not establish a nonzero limiting mass, a probability
transport through zero energy, a continuum interacting theory, or the
Yang--Mills Millennium conclusion. They do establish that the original
weighted covariance cannot be discarded as a vanishing denominator on this
path, and they replace the earlier exponential lower bound by a polynomial
one. The near-zero spectral inverse and the continuum construction remain
separate questions addressed only by further proved calculations.

# 26. An explicit finite-volume spectral window for the weighted covariance

Section25 gives a lower bound for the total spectral weight of the actual
vector \(Q\Gamma\psi\), but a covariance lower bound alone does not select an
energy interval. The next calculation supplies such an interval at each
finite \(L\), using the actual Hamiltonian commutator. It is an unconditional
finite-volume statement. Its displayed upper endpoint is not asserted to be
uniform in \(L\) or in the prescribed cusp.

## 26.1. Spectral measure and an exact first-moment identity

Let
\[
 A=H-\mathcal E,\qquad v_\Gamma=Q\Gamma\psi,\qquad
 \nu_\Gamma(B)=\langle v_\Gamma,P_A(B)v_\Gamma\rangle
 \tag{26.1}
\]
for Borel sets \(B\subset[0,\infty)\), where \(P_A\) is the spectral
projection of the finite-box operator \(A\). Since \(A\psi=0\) and
\(Q\Gamma\psi=\Gamma\psi-\langle\psi,\Gamma\psi\rangle\psi\),

\[
[H_0,\Gamma]=0,
\qquad [2bM I,\Gamma]=0,
\qquad [H,\Gamma]=-b[\mathcal W,\Gamma].
\]
The first equality holds because \(H_0\) and \(\Gamma\) are real linear
combinations of the mutually commuting link Casimirs; the second holds
because \(M\) is the scalar plaquette count, not an additional operator.
Thus, on the smooth finite-box ground state,

\[
 A v_\Gamma=A\Gamma\psi=[H,\Gamma]\psi
 =-b[\mathcal W,\Gamma]\psi .
 \tag{26.2}
\]

The finite product of compact groups is smooth, the potential is smooth,
and elliptic regularity gives \(\psi\in C^\infty\). Hence
\(\Gamma\psi\), \(v_\Gamma\), and the right side of (26.2) are smooth;
in particular \(v_\Gamma\in\operatorname{Dom}(A)\), and the first spectral
moment below is finite. Since \(A\ge0\), the spectral theorem gives
\[
 \nu_\Gamma([0,\infty))=\|v_\Gamma\|^2,\qquad
 \int_{[0,\infty)}\lambda\,d\nu_\Gamma(\lambda)
 =\langle v_\Gamma,Av_\Gamma\rangle
 \le \left|\langle v_\Gamma,Av_\Gamma\rangle\right|
 \le b\|v_\Gamma\|\,\|[\mathcal W,\Gamma]\psi\|.
 \tag{26.3}
\]

## 26.2. Direct commutator estimate with the original weights

For a multiplication function \(F\), the fixed \(T_a\) convention gives
\[
 \begin{aligned}
 [F,E_e]\psi
 &=F\left(-\sum_aX_{e,a}^2\psi\right)
   +\sum_aX_{e,a}^2(F\psi)\\
 &=\left(\sum_{a=1}^3X_{e,a}^2F\right)\psi
 +2\sum_{a=1}^3(X_{e,a}F)X_{e,a}\psi .
 \end{aligned}
 \tag{26.4}
\]
This is the product rule with the signs from \(E_e=-\sum_aX_{e,a}^2\)
left unchanged.
Let \(r_e\) be the number of plaquettes incident to \(e\). Every incident plaquette
trace has
\[
 \left|\sum_aX_{e,a}^2W_p\right|
 =\frac34|W_p|\le\frac32,\qquad
 \left(\sum_a|X_{e,a}W_p|^2\right)^{1/2}\le1 .
 \tag{26.5}
\]
The triangle inequality over the \(r_e\) incident plaquettes and
\(\langle\psi,E_e\psi\rangle\le8\xi\) consequently gives
\[
 [\mathcal W,E_e]\psi
 =\sum_{p\ni e}[W_p,E_e]\psi,
 \qquad
 \|[\mathcal W,E_e]\psi\|
 \le r_e\left(\frac32+2\sqrt{8\xi}\right).
 \tag{26.6}
\]
Indeed, (26.4)--(26.5), \(\|\psi\|=1\), and pointwise
Cauchy--Schwarz give for each incident \(p\)
\[
 \|[W_p,E_e]\psi\|
 \le \frac32\|\psi\|+
 2\left\|\left(\sum_a|X_{e,a}W_p|^2\right)^{1/2}\right\|_\infty
    \left(\sum_a\|X_{e,a}\psi\|^2\right)^{1/2}
 \le \frac32+2\sqrt{8\xi}.
\]
Only direction-one edges occur in \(\Gamma\). Define the exact weighted
incidence sum
\[
 R_{1,L}:=\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2r_e .
 \tag{26.7}
\]
Since \(2\le r_e\le4\),
\[
 R_{1,L}\le4S_{1,L},\qquad
 S_{1,L}=\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2
 =\frac23L^2(L+1)(2L+1)^2 .
 \tag{26.8}
\]
Using (26.4)--(26.8) without changing any weight yields
\[
 \|[\mathcal W,\Gamma]\psi\|
 \le R_{1,L}\left(\frac32+2\sqrt{8\xi}\right)
 \le S_{1,L}\left(6+8\sqrt{8\xi}\right).
 \tag{26.9}
\]
Also, put \(m_2(\xi)=6\xi+128\xi^2\). The part
\(\|E_e^2\psi\|\le6\xi+128\xi^2\) of (13.2) holds for every \(\xi>0\);
its subsequent small-coupling estimate by \(7\xi\) is not used here.
Self-adjointness on the smooth vector and Cauchy--Schwarz give
\[
\|E_e\psi\|^2
=\langle\psi,E_e^2\psi\rangle
\le\|\psi\|\,\|E_e^2\psi\|\le m_2(\xi).
\]
Consequently
\[
 \|\Gamma\psi\|
 \le\sum_{e=(n,1)}n_2^2\|E_e\psi\|
 \le S_{1,L}\sqrt{m_2(\xi)} .
 \tag{26.10}
\]

## 26.3. A proved low-energy window

Put
\[
 b_{\Gamma}(L,\xi):=
 \frac{\xi\,\sigma(16\xi)(L+1)(2L+1)}
 {18(6+64\xi)} ,
 \tag{26.11}
\]
so that (25.23) says \(\|v_\Gamma\|\ge b_\Gamma(L,\xi)>0\). Equations
(26.3), (26.9), (26.10), and
\(\|v_\Gamma\|\le\|\Gamma\psi\|\) give the first-moment upper bound
\[
 \int\lambda\,d\nu_\Gamma(\lambda)
 \le Q_{\Gamma}(L,\xi):=
 b\,S_{1,L}^{\,2}\sqrt{m_2(\xi)}
 \cdot\left(6+8\sqrt{8\xi}\right).
 \tag{26.12}
\]
For \(R>0\), positivity of \(\nu_\Gamma\) and
\(\lambda\ge R\) on \((R,\infty)\) imply the exact Markov estimate
\[
 \nu_\Gamma((R,\infty))
 \le\frac1R\int\lambda\,d\nu_\Gamma(\lambda).
 \tag{26.13}
\]
Choose
\[
 R_{\Gamma}(L,\xi):=
 \frac{2Q_{\Gamma}(L,\xi)}{b_{\Gamma}(L,\xi)^2}.
 \tag{26.14}
\]
Then (26.12)--(26.14) prove
\[
 \boxed{\displaystyle
 \nu_\Gamma([0,R_{\Gamma}(L,\xi)])
 \ge \|v_\Gamma\|^2-\frac12b_\Gamma(L,\xi)^2
 \ge\frac12b_\Gamma(L,\xi)^2>0 .}
 \tag{26.15}
\]
The interval in (26.15) is an actual spectral window for the weighted
covariance vector of the full finite-box Hamiltonian. It includes the
endpoint zero only as a Borel endpoint; the ground-state simplicity already
implies \(\nu_\Gamma(\{0\})=0\), because \(v_\Gamma\perp\psi\).

On the unchanged logarithmic path, (26.11) gives the explicit liminf lower rate
\[
 \liminf_{j\to\infty}
 \frac{(\log j)^8}{j^8}\,b_\Gamma(j^2,\xi_j)^2
 \ge\frac1{9216^2}.
 \tag{26.16}
\]
while (26.12)--(26.14) retain the original \(b_j\), \(S_{1,j}\), and
\(\xi_j\) coefficients. No uniform positive upper endpoint, no uniform
spectral gap, and no continuum mass statement follows from (26.15).
What is proved is the finite-volume existence of nonzero actual covariance
spectral weight in an explicitly computed interval, with its amount and
endpoint both retained rather than replaced by a qualitative assertion.

## 26.4. Exact behavior of the displayed endpoint on the prescribed path

The preceding statement does not by itself say whether the displayed endpoint
is useful at a fixed energy. That question can be answered for the prescribed
path without replacing any of the definitions in (26.11)--(26.14). Write

\[
 \ell_j=\log j,\qquad L_j=j^2,\qquad \xi_j=\frac{\ell_j^2}{4},
 \qquad b_j=50j\ell_j.
 \tag{26.17}
\]

The exact factors entering (26.11) and (26.12) are then

\[
 \frac{S_{1,L_j}}{j^{10}}
 =\frac23\left(1+\frac1{j^2}\right)
             \left(2+\frac1{j^2}\right)^2,
 \tag{26.18}
\]

\[
 \frac{\sqrt{m_2(\xi_j)}}{\ell_j^2}
 =\sqrt{8+\frac{3}{2\ell_j^2}},
 \qquad
 \frac{6+8\sqrt{8\xi_j}}{\ell_j}
 =\frac6{\ell_j}+8\sqrt2,
 \tag{26.19}
\]

and, using the second exact expression in (25.6),

\[
 \ell_j^4\sigma(16\xi_j)
 =\frac{4}{\left(\sqrt{16+6/\ell_j^4}+4\right)^2}.
 \tag{26.20}
\]

For \(j>1\), all displayed denominators are positive. Therefore the
elementary limits \(j^{-2}\to0\) and \(\ell_j\to\infty\), applied to the
exact factors (26.18)--(26.20), give

\[
 \lim_{j\to\infty}
 \frac{Q_\Gamma(j^2,\xi_j)}{j^{21}\ell_j^4}
 =50\left(\frac83\right)^2(2\sqrt2)(8\sqrt2)
 =\frac{102400}{9}.
 \tag{26.21}
\]

Equation (25.24), with its retained factors, gives independently

\[
 \lim_{j\to\infty}
 \frac{\ell_j^4 b_\Gamma(j^2,\xi_j)}{j^4}
 =\frac1{16}\cdot\frac1{64}\cdot\frac2{18}
 =\frac1{9216}.
 \tag{26.22}
\]

Substitution of the exact definition (26.14), followed by (26.21)--(26.22),
now proves the endpoint asymptotic

\[
 \boxed{\displaystyle
 \lim_{j\to\infty}
 \frac{R_\Gamma(j^2,\xi_j)}{j^{13}\ell_j^{12}}
 =2\,\frac{102400}{9}\,9216^2
 =1\,932\,735\,283\,200.}
 \tag{26.23}
\]

In particular, the certified interval in (26.15) has an upper endpoint that
diverges like the explicit positive multiple in (26.23). The finite-volume
Markov estimate therefore does not place a nonzero amount of this weighted
covariance in any fixed interval \([0,R]\) along this path: its certified
interval itself moves to arbitrarily large energy. This is a proved limitation
of the present first-moment estimate, not a statement that the covariance has
no fixed-window spectral weight and not a statement about the spectrum of the
continuum theory. A fixed-window conclusion would require a separate estimate
whose endpoint remains bounded after the volume and coupling are varied.
