# Local energy, curvature profiles, and the common lowest-band map

Complete section of the cumulative manuscript, 9 September 2026.

 

The global spectral projection of Section 14 now receives local weighted-energy states and observables. We calculate its entire vacuum-plus-first-band operator, its raw matrix elements against the full Fabel state, and its two physical time scales. We also retain the exact terms that leave this band. A compressed product is not substituted for a product of the original local operators.

## Graph convergence on the actual excited space

All definitions and coefficients of Sections 1, 13 and 14 remain in force. We first extend the vacuum graph calculation to the actual finite physical eigenspaces. At fixed $L,a$, let $u_g$ be an original physical eigenvector, with eigenvalue $e_g$ in a bounded interval and bounded squared norm. Positivity of $u_g$ is not required. For a real smooth multiplier $F$, expand the full kinetic product and use the eigenvalue equation, taking its real part. The exact identity is 

$$
\qquad\text{(131)}
 q_H[Fu_g]-e_g\|Fu_g\|^2
 =\kappa\sum_{e,\alpha}\int |u_g|^2|X_{e,\alpha}F|^2\,dU.
$$

 The terms $F^2|Xu_g|^2$ and $2F\operatorname{Re}(\overline{u_g}Xu_g)XF$ occur on both sides of the integration-by-parts eigenvalue identity; their cancellation proves the formula also for complex $u_g$.

Put $M_k(u_g)=\int W^k|u_g|^2\,dU$. The same regularized powers and the exact bound $\sum|XW|^2\le16W$ used in Section 14 give 

$$
bM_{k+1}(u_g)\le e_gM_k(u_g)+4\kappa k^2M_{k-1}(u_g),
 \qquad bM_1(u_g)\le e_gM_0(u_g).
$$

 Thus for every fixed $k$, $M_k(u_g)/g^{2k}$ is bounded at fixed $L,a$. The constants are uniform over a bounded-energy unit eigenspace. If $\mathcal B_gu_g\to u_0$ strongly and $e_g\to e_0$, the third moment gives the same chart-tail estimate for $(W/g^2)u_g$ as for the vacuum. Local Taylor convergence proves 

$$
\mathcal B_g((W/g^2)u_g)\to V_2u_0,\qquad
 \mathcal B_g(g^2H_0u_g)\to
          (ae_0/2-V_2/4)u_0=Du_0 .
$$

 The second identity is the full eigenvalue equation $g^2H_0u_g=(ae_g/2)u_g-(W/(4g^2))u_g$. For every fixed real edge weight $f$, the strongly commuting Casimir inequality $\|\sum_ef_eE_eF\|\le\|f\|_\infty\|H_0F\|$ and compactly supported Gaussian-polynomial graph approximations prove the arbitrary electric-weight graph limit, exactly as in Section 14. The weighted magnetic limit follows from $|W_f|\le\max_p|f_p|W$. These arguments prove 

$$
\qquad\text{(132)}
 \mathcal B_gD_fu_g\longrightarrow D_f^{\mathrm{osc}}u_0
$$

 in full $L^2$, with the original factors $2/a$ and $1/(8a)$, for every eigenvector limit in any fixed finite physical spectral range.

To obtain this result for a finite spectral frame, choose an eigenbasis of that range along an arbitrary sequence $g\downarrow0$. The retained compactness and projection theorem gives a subsequence on which every basis vector converges. Apply the preceding moment and graph estimates to each vector; bounded finite linear combinations preserve them. The limit identifies the same operator matrix independently of the chosen subsequence and eigenbasis. Therefore the graph conclusion holds for the original finite spectral projections, including degenerate bands, not merely a chosen eigenvector subsequence.

## Exact common coordinates and the whole compressed operator

Let 

$$
\mathcal K=\mathbb C\oplus\operatorname{Sym}_3(\mathbb C),\qquad
 \langle(c,B),(d,E)\rangle_{\mathcal K}
 =\overline c\,d+6\operatorname{tr}(B^*E).
$$

 The factor $6$ is the unchanged creation-vector norm: 

$$
\Phi(B)=\sum_{i,k=1}^3B_{ik}
            \sum_{\alpha=1}^3a_{i,\alpha}^\dagger
                            a_{k,\alpha}^\dagger\Phi_0,
 \qquad \langle\Phi(B),\Phi(E)\rangle=6\operatorname{tr}(B^*E).
$$

 Commuting two annihilators through two creators proves this formula for complex symmetric matrices; off-diagonal entries occur twice in the displayed sum and twice in the matrix trace. Define the comparison isometry $I_{L,a}(c,B)=c\Phi_0+\Phi(B)$ using the three exact lowest modes of Section 14.

Write $P_g$ for the first-band projection on $(\Delta/2,11\Delta/10)$ and $\Pi_g=|\psi_g\rangle\langle\psi_g|+P_g$. For sufficiently small positive $g$ define 

$$
\qquad\text{(133)}
 M_g(c,B)=c\psi_g+P_g\mathcal B_g^*\Phi(B),\qquad G_g=M_g^*M_g.
$$

 Here every adjoint on $\mathcal K$ uses its displayed factor-$6$ inner product. Projection convergence proves $G_g\to I$ in operator norm. In particular $G_g$ is positive definite for small $g$, $M_g$ is a bijection onto the actual seven-dimensional range of $\Pi_g$, and its exact inverse there is 

$$
M_g^{-1}=G_g^{-1}M_g^*,\qquad
 M_g^{-1}M_g=I,\qquad M_gM_g^{-1}=\Pi_g.
$$

 The last equality on the full Hilbert space means the indicated orthogonal projection. These identities follow by multiplication and the equality of the range dimensions. No original vector or frame column is divided by its norm. The complete finite-$g$ Gram tensor $G_g$ is retained.

Put $C_{g,f}=D_f-\langle\psi_g,D_f\psi_g\rangle$. Let $J_f=\Sigma^{1/2}A_f\Sigma^{1/2}$ and $K_f=\Sigma^{-1/2}M_f\Sigma^{-1/2}$ in the notation of (114); here the face matrix $M_f$ is not the Hilbert frame $M_g$. Set 

$$
\mathsf R_f=K_f-J_f,\qquad \mathsf Q_f=K_f+J_f.
$$

 The full centered oscillator operator is 

$$
\qquad\text{(134)}
 C_{0,f}=\frac1{4a}\sum_{\nu,\eta,\alpha}
 \left[(\mathsf R_f)_{\nu\eta}
 (a_{\nu,\alpha}a_{\eta,\alpha}
       +a_{\nu,\alpha}^\dagger a_{\eta,\alpha}^\dagger)
       +2(\mathsf Q_f)_{\nu\eta}
                      a_{\nu,\alpha}^\dagger a_{\eta,\alpha}\right].
$$

 Expand $\partial_z=\sqrt{\sigma}/(2\sqrt2)(a-a^\dagger)$ and $z=\sqrt{2/\sigma}(a+a^\dagger)$ in the full electric and magnetic quadratic forms to obtain this identity. Their vacuum scalar is $3\operatorname{tr}(\mathsf Q_f)/(4a)$; subtracting that scalar gives exactly (134). No magnetic or number-preserving term is discarded.

Use superscript $\min$ for the three-lowest-mode blocks. The resulting exact compressed operator on $\mathcal K$ is 

$$
\qquad\text{(135)}
 \mathcal D_{0,f}(c,B)=
 \left(\frac{3}{2a}\operatorname{tr}(\mathsf R_f^{\min}B),
 \ \frac{c}{4a}\mathsf R_f^{\min}
       +\frac1{2a}(\mathsf Q_f^{\min}B+B\mathsf Q_f^{\min})\right).
$$

 Indeed the pair annihilation gives $6\operatorname{tr}(\mathsf R_f^{\min}B)/(4a)$ in the vacuum, pair creation from the vacuum gives the second component, and the commutator of $\sum Q_{\nu\eta}a_\nu^\dagger a_\eta$ with $\Phi(B)$ is $\Phi(QB+BQ^{\mathsf T})$. Higher-mode terms are outside the compressed range; they will be retained below. The graph result (132) proves 

$$
\qquad\text{(136)}
 \mathcal D_{g,f}:=
 G_g^{-1}M_g^*\Pi_gC_{g,f}\Pi_gM_g
 \longrightarrow\mathcal D_{0,f}
$$

 in the finite-dimensional operator norm. The original compressed operator is self-adjoint for the Gram inner product $G_g$: $G_g\mathcal D_{g,f}=\mathcal D_{g,f}^*G_g$.

## Compact physical supports and all leading spatial factors

For real $h\in C_c(\mathbb R^3)$ use the exact local weights 

$$
f_{h,j}(e)=h(a_jm(e)),\qquad
 f_{h,j}(p)=\frac14\sum_{e\in\partial p}h(a_jm(e)),
 \quad L_j=j^2,\quad a_j=\frac1{100j}.
$$

 These define a finite sum of the original local electric and magnetic operators. A face adjacent to the sampled support is retained whenever its four-edge average is nonzero. Put 

$$
N_j=2L_j+1,\quad \ell_j=a_jN_j,\quad
 H_h=\int_{\mathbb R^3}h(x)\,dx,\quad
 H_{h,ik}=\int_{\mathbb R^3}x_ix_kh(x)\,dx.
$$

 The vertex endpoints remain at $\pm L_ja_j$; $\ell_j$ is the specified difference-basis length $a_j(2L_j+1)$, not a replacement for the endpoint distance.

### Theorem 15.1.

For the full comparison matrices of these local weights, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \frac{\ell_j^4}{a_j}\mathsf R_{h,j}^{\min}
 &\longrightarrow4\sqrt2\pi H_h I_3,
 &
 \frac{\ell_j^4}{a_j}\mathsf Q_{h,j}^{\min}
 &\longrightarrow4\sqrt2\pi H_h I_3, \qquad\text{(137)}\\
 \frac{\ell_j^6}{a_j}(\mathsf R_{h,j}^{\min})_{ik}
 &\longrightarrow2\sqrt2\pi^3 H_{h,ik}
 &&(i\ne k). \qquad\text{(138)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 In particular the complete raw first-band mass obeys 

$$
\qquad\text{(139)}
 \ell_j^8d_{L_j,a_j}(f_{h,j})\longrightarrow36\pi^2 H_h^2.
$$

 Here $d(f)$ denotes $3\operatorname{tr}((\mathsf R_f^{\min})^2)/(8a^2)$ for arbitrary weights, extending the quadratic-weight notation of (120).

### Proof.

Let $V_i$ be the original edge functions (117) and $Y_i=d_1V_i/\sigma_j$. Put 

$$
A^h_{ik}=\sum_ef_{h,j}(e)V_i(e)V_k(e),\qquad
 F^h_{ik}=\sum_pf_{h,j}(p)Y_i(p)Y_k(p).
$$

 Then, exactly, $\mathsf R_h^{\min}=\sigma_j(F^h-A^h)$ and $\mathsf Q_h^{\min}=\sigma_j(F^h+A^h)$. Different $Y_i$ have disjoint face-plane supports, so $F^h_{ik}=0$ for $i\ne k$ with any face weight. For the plane $(p,q)$ normal to $i$, 

$$
Y_i(n)^2=\frac4{N_j^3}
 \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi a_j(n_p+1/2)}{\ell_j}\right)
 \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi a_j(n_q+1/2)}{\ell_j}\right).
$$

 The sign of the ordered curl disappears here by squaring; it was not changed. On every fixed physical compact set the two cosine factors tend uniformly to one. The quarter-face sample differs uniformly from $h$ at the face center by at most its modulus of continuity at distance $a_j/2$. The support increases by at most that distance. The face-center Riemann sums with volume factor $a_j^3$ consequently give 

$$
\ell_j^3 F^h_{ii}\longrightarrow4H_h.
$$

 For clarity, uniform continuity bounds each sample error, the number of nonzero samples times $a_j^3$ stays bounded in a fixed enlarged compact cube, and the ordinary shifted cubic partition proves convergence of the remaining Riemann sum. Thus the four edges and the open endpoints contribute no unrecorded limit term.

For $V_i$ on direction $p$ its squared factor is 

$$
\frac2{N_j^3}
 \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi a_j(n_p+1/2)}{\ell_j}\right)
 \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi a_jn_q}{\ell_j}\right),
$$

 and there is the other directional term with $p,q$ interchanged. On a fixed support, $|\sin(\pi x/\ell_j)|\le\pi|x|/\ell_j$. The same sample-count estimate gives $A^h_{ii}=O_h(\ell_j^{-5})$. Cauchy--Schwarz with $|h|$ also bounds every $A^h_{ik}=O_h(\ell_j^{-5})$.

More precisely, distinct normal indices $i,k$ share only the remaining edge direction $d$. On that edge the exact product is 

$$
V_i(n,d)V_k(n,d)=
 -\frac2{N_j^3}
 \sin\left(\frac{\pi a_jn_i}{\ell_j}\right)
 \sin\left(\frac{\pi a_jn_k}{\ell_j}\right)
 \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi a_j(n_d+1/2)}{\ell_j}\right).
$$

 Keeping the two original signs and using uniform convergence $\ell_j\sin(\pi x/\ell_j)\to\pi x$ on the fixed support proves 

$$
\ell_j^5 A^h_{ik}\longrightarrow-2\pi^2H_{h,ik}.
$$

 Finally $\ell_j\sigma_j/a_j=N_j\sqrt8\sin(\pi/(2N_j))
\to\sqrt2\pi$. These identities prove both matrix limits. Insert the first into the exact raw mass formula to get $3\cdot3(4\sqrt2\pi)^2H_h^2/8=36\pi^2H_h^2$.

This calculation retains spatial information beyond the leading integral: (138) is an explicit map to three mixed spatial moments. A vanishing integral does not imply that the original weighted state or these next coefficients vanish.

## One positive-coupling diagonal and its raw common representation

The finite-regulator convergence can be enforced for every bounded edge weight at once at each fixed $j$. There are finitely many original edges. Let $b^{(e)}$ be the weight one at $e$ and zero elsewhere, with its prescribed face averages. Both the actual centered operator and its comparison matrix are linear in this weight. Choose 

$$
\epsilon_j=j^{-40}(1+\ell_j)^{-10}.
$$

 At each fixed $j$, take the least positive integer $n_j$ such that $g_j=2^{-n_j}<1/j$ satisfies the finite inequalities of Theorem 14.2, $\|G_{g_j}-I\|<\epsilon_j$, and 

$$
\|\mathcal D_{g_j,b^{(e)}}-\mathcal D_{0,b^{(e)}}\|
       <\epsilon_j/|\mathsf E_{L_j}|\quad(e\in\mathsf E_{L_j}).
$$

 Also require the exact frame energy matrix to differ from $0\oplus\Delta_jI$ by less than $\epsilon_j$, and the frame coefficient of the full projected Fabel state to differ from $(0,\mathsf R_{S_j}^{\min}/(4a_j))$ by less than $\epsilon_j$. Projection, graph and eigenvalue convergence prove existence for this finite list. This is a defined stricter coupling sequence; it does not silently reuse a previously chosen $g_j$ for new inequalities. All conclusions of Section 14 persist.

For every real edge weight $f$, finite linearity now gives the uniform bound 

$$
\|\mathcal D_{g_j,f}-\mathcal D_{0,f}\|
 \le\epsilon_j\|f\|_\infty.
$$

 The energy and Fabel coordinate requirements also follow from the fixed-box frame and vector convergence already proved. All actual states and operators retain their original coefficients $\kappa_j=200jg_j^2$, $b_j=50j/g_j^2$, and full Wilson scalar.

### Theorem 15.2.

For every real $h\in C_c(\mathbb R^3)$, the actual Gram and compressed operator coordinates satisfy 

$$
G_{g_j}\to I,\qquad
 \ell_j^4\mathcal D_{g_j,f_{h,j}}\to\mathcal T_h
$$

 in operator norm on the fixed space $\mathcal K$, where 

$$
\qquad\text{(140)}
 \mathcal T_h(c,B)=
 \sqrt2\pi H_h\bigl(6\operatorname{tr}B,\ cI_3+4B\bigr).
$$

 The actual excitation matrix $\mathcal A_j$ satisfies 

$$
\qquad\text{(141)}
 \mathcal A_j\to0,\qquad
 \ell_j\mathcal A_j\to
       \mathcal A_*:=0\oplus2\sqrt2\pi I.
$$

 These limits include all finite products of the displayed compressed operators and their compressed time evolution.

### Proof.

Apply (137) to each term of (135), and use $\ell_j^4\epsilon_j\|h\|_\infty\to0$. The first component becomes $6\sqrt2\pi H_h\operatorname{tr}B$; the other two become $\sqrt2\pi H_hcI$ and $4\sqrt2\pi H_hB$. This proves (140), including its adjoint relation in the original factor-$6$ metric. The exact energy frame is block diagonal because the vacuum and excited range are invariant and orthogonal. Its specified error and $\ell_j\Delta_j\to2\sqrt2\pi$ give (141). Operator-norm convergence in a fixed finite-dimensional space preserves finite products. The exponential power series, uniformly bounded on each fixed compact time interval, gives convergence of the displayed time evolutions.

The map $h\mapsto\mathcal T_h$ is explicitly the integral functional times the single displayed operator. On the traceless matrices its eigenvalue is $4\sqrt2\pi H_h$; on the vacuum/trace coordinates its matrix is $\sqrt2\pi H_h\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0&18\\1&4\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ in the basis $(1,0),(0,I)$, whose squared norms are $1,18$. Its characteristic roots are $\sqrt2\pi H_h(2+\sqrt{22})$ and $\sqrt2\pi H_h(2-\sqrt{22})$. This is a finite-dimensional self-adjoint compressed observable with all raw metric factors, not an assertion that the full local-energy algebra has collapsed.

Let $v_{h,j}=P_{g_j}\Xi_{f_{h,j}}$. The exact vacuum component of $\Xi$ vanishes. Equations (133)--(140) therefore give its coordinate limit 

$$
\ell_j^4M_{g_j}^{-1}v_{h,j}
 \longrightarrow(0,\sqrt2\pi H_hI).
$$

 This equation records the raw amplitude $\ell_j^{-4}$. It defines no unit-vector rescaling. In particular, for real compact $h,k$ and fixed physical Euclidean time $t\ge0$, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \ell_j^8\langle v_{h,j},e^{-t(H_j-\mathcal E_j)}v_{k,j}\rangle
 &\longrightarrow36\pi^2H_hH_k,\qquad\text{(142)}\\
 \ell_j^8\langle v_{h,j},
       e^{-\ell_j\theta(H_j-\mathcal E_j)}v_{k,j}\rangle
 &\longrightarrow36\pi^2H_hH_k e^{-2\sqrt2\pi\theta}
 \quad(\theta\ge0).\qquad\text{(143)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 These follow by inserting the exact Gram $G_{g_j}$ and the exact energy matrix in the inner product. The second equation records the explicit time change $t=\ell_j\theta$; it is not used to replace the original Hamiltonian or its physical energy quotient. At fixed physical time this particular finite band becomes a zero-energy sector. At times proportional to the box length its nontrivial dynamics are the explicitly displayed finite matrix. The same actual energy matrix gives the raw first-moment limit 

$$
\ell_j^9\langle v_{h,j},(H_j-\mathcal E_j)v_{h,j}\rangle
 \longrightarrow72\sqrt2\pi^3H_h^2.
$$

 When $H_h\ne0$, the raw norm limit is strictly positive after its displayed $\ell_j^8$ factor, so $v_{h,j}\ne0$ eventually and 

$$
\ell_j\frac{\langle v_{h,j},(H_j-\mathcal E_j)v_{h,j}\rangle}
                   {\|v_{h,j}\|^2}\longrightarrow2\sqrt2\pi.
$$

 The vectors themselves retain their vanishing raw norms.

For the unchanged Fabel states $w_j$ of Section 14 let $S_*=\eta\eta^{\mathsf T}$ as there, and define the full fixed matrix 

$$
(B_*)_{ii}=-\frac{25\sqrt2}{\pi}
                    (\operatorname{tr}S_*-S_{*,ii}),\qquad
 (B_*)_{ik}=\frac{400\sqrt2}{\pi^3}S_{*,ik}\quad(i\ne k).
$$

 The exact lowest-mode coefficients give $M_{g_j}^{-1}w_j=j^9(0,B_*+o(1))$ and $6\operatorname{tr}(B_*^2)=\mathcal C_*$. Consequently the original raw matrix elements obey 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \frac{\ell_j^4}{j^{18}}
 \langle w_j,C_{g_j,f_{h,j}}w_j\rangle
 &\longrightarrow4\sqrt2\pi H_h\mathcal C_*,
 \qquad\text{(144)}\\
 \frac{\ell_j^4}{j^9}
 \langle\psi_j,C_{g_j,f_{h,j}}w_j\rangle
 &\longrightarrow-\frac{25275}{8}H_h.
 \qquad\text{(145)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 The first follows from the band component $4\sqrt2\pi H_hB$ of (140). For the sign and constant in the second, $\operatorname{tr}S_*=337/64$ and $\operatorname{tr}B_*=-8425\sqrt2/(32\pi)$; multiplication by $6\sqrt2\pi H_h$ yields the result. Thus the quotient of the first raw expectation by $\|w_j\|^2$ decays as $4\sqrt2\pi H_h/\ell_j^4$ when $H_h\ne0$, even though the unscaled raw expectation itself grows. Neither conclusion is inferred by dropping the Fabel amplitude.

## The map from a compact Navier--Stokes curvature profile

Take any actual smooth compactly supported incompressible velocity profile $u(s,\cdot)$ at a regular time $s$ in the Navier--Stokes construction under study. Its viscosity, force, pressure and time interval remain the ones of that construction. Set 

$$
\mathcal A_0=0,\quad\mathcal A_i=\lambda u_iT,\quad
 T=-i\sigma_3/2,\qquad
 h_s(x)=\sum_{i<k}-2\operatorname{tr}(F_{ik}(s,x)^2)
                =\lambda^2|\operatorname{curl}u(s,x)|^2.
$$

 Here $F_{ik}=\lambda(\partial_iu_k-\partial_ku_i)T$ and $-2\operatorname{tr}(T^2)=1$ prove the equality. The weighted local-energy operator uses the full profile: $f_{s,j}(e)=h_s(a_jm(e))$, with all prescribed face averages. The composition 

$$
u(s,\cdot)\longmapsto h_s\longmapsto D_{f_{s,j}}
 \longmapsto\Xi_{f_{s,j}}\longmapsto P_{g_j}\Xi_{f_{s,j}}
$$

 is now a specified map into the actual physical Hilbert space. Its raw first-band masses and mixed-time spectral matrix elements are (139), (142) and (143), with 

$$
H_{h_s}=\lambda^2\|\operatorname{curl}u(s,\cdot)\|_2^2,
 \qquad
 H_{h_s,ik}=\lambda^2\int x_ix_k|\operatorname{curl}u(s,x)|^2\,dx.
$$

 For $\lambda\ne0$ and a nonzero compact smooth incompressible profile, $H_{h_s}>0$. Indeed integration by parts gives $\int|\nabla u|^2=\int|\operatorname{curl}u|^2+
\int|\operatorname{div}u|^2$; if its curl vanishes, all derivatives vanish and compact support forces $u=0$. Thus this particular local-curvature state has nonzero first-band mass at sufficiently late regulators, with all norm powers explicit.

This is a regular-time profile map. It does not assert that $H_{h_s}$ diverges as a blowup time is approached: pointwise concentration and its spatial integral remain distinct quantities in the displayed exact map. The full sourced current $j_i=(\lambda/g^2)(\Delta u_i-c^{-2}\partial_s^2u_i)T$ from Section 13 is unchanged. No equality between evolution in the fluid parameter $s$ and the quantum time $t$ or $\theta$ is used or claimed. The limits above apply to every fixed regular profile; a simultaneous singular-fluid-time limit is not exchanged with the regulator limits. Only the nonzero compact incompressible profile, rather than its singular endpoint, was used to prove positive band mass. The gap-closing projected sequence therefore does not establish an implication specific to Navier--Stokes breakdown.

## All terms leaving the seven-dimensional range

Let $\widehat Q_g=I-\Pi_g$. On the original smooth spectral range, the exact identity is 

$$
\qquad\text{(146)}
 \Pi_g C_{g,h}C_{g,k}\Pi_g
 =\Pi_gC_{g,h}\Pi_gC_{g,k}\Pi_g+
       (\widehat Q_gC_{g,h}\Pi_g)^*
                        (\widehat Q_gC_{g,k}\Pi_g).
$$

 Each finite-range eigenvector is smooth, each weighted differential operator preserves smoothness, and its formal adjoint is its self-adjoint realization there. Inserting $I=\Pi_g+\widehat Q_g$ therefore proves the identity with no domain omission. For $h=k$ the last term is positive. Products of the compressed limits alone do not determine this term.

The fixed-box graph limit proves the exact comparison for every leakage matrix element as well. Here are its full coordinates. Extend a lowest-mode symmetric $B$ by zero to all modes and put $\mathcal S_B= \sum_{\nu,\eta,\alpha}
B_{\nu\eta}a_{\nu,\alpha}^\dagger a_{\eta,\alpha}^\dagger$. Let $\mathsf P_\perp$ remove the lowest $3$-by-$3$ block of a symmetric mode matrix. From (134), 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \widehat Q_0C_{0,f}\Phi_0
 &=\frac1{4a}\Phi(\mathsf P_\perp\mathsf R_f),
 \qquad\text{(147)}\\
 \widehat Q_0C_{0,f}\Phi(B)
 &=\frac1{4a}\mathcal S_{\mathsf R_f}\mathcal S_B\Phi_0
 +\frac1{2a}
 \Phi\!\left(\mathsf P_\perp(\mathsf Q_fB+B\mathsf Q_f)\right).
 \qquad\text{(148)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 In these equations $\Phi$ on a full mode matrix uses the same colour-contracted formula over every spatial mode. The two terms on the right in (148) have respectively four and two creation operators, hence are orthogonal. The annihilation term has landed in the vacuum and is included in $\Pi_0$, so it is absent for that exact reason. In particular 

$$
\|\widehat Q_0C_{0,f}\Phi_0\|^2
 =\frac3{8a^2}\left[
 \operatorname{tr}(\mathsf R_f^2)
           -\operatorname{tr}((\mathsf R_f^{\min})^2)\right].
$$

 The four-creation contraction also has a completely explicit finite sum. With combined indices $I=(\nu,\alpha)$ define $T_{I_1I_2I_3I_4}
=(\mathsf R_f)_{\nu_1\nu_2}B_{\nu_3\nu_4}
\delta_{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\delta_{\alpha_3\alpha_4}$. For another pair of matrices producing coefficients $U$, 

$$
\left\langle\mathcal S_{\mathsf R_f}\mathcal S_B\Phi_0,
              \mathcal S_{\mathsf R_k}\mathcal S_E\Phi_0\right\rangle
 =\sum_{I_1,\ldots,I_4}\sum_{J_1,\ldots,J_4}
 \overline{T_{I_1I_2I_3I_4}}U_{J_1J_2J_3J_4}
 \sum_{\pi\in S_4}\prod_{r=1}^4\delta_{I_rJ_{\pi(r)}}.
$$

 Repeatedly commute the four annihilators through the four creators; every surviving vacuum term is one of these $24$ pairings, proving the formula with its multiplicities and colour factors. The two-creation term has the already-proved factor-$6$ trace inner product. These equations give every omitted-intermediate covariance in (146) at fixed box and coupling limit.

We have constructed a common finite-dimensional representation of the exact compressed local-energy maps, including their raw coupling to Fabel and compact Navier--Stokes profiles. Its fixed physical-time energy is zero and its leading spatial functional is the integral, with explicitly retained next mixed moments. Section 16 evaluates the full unprojected vacuum two-creation spectral measure in the joint infinite-volume continuum limit, using the exact mode maps above. Products on excited states still retain the four-creation terms displayed here. Their continuum products and the survival of nonabelian interactions require further calculation before this sequence can identify a local interacting four-dimensional Yang--Mills theory.
