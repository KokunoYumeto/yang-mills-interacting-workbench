# A nonzero nonabelian vertex and the actual vacuum response

Complete section of the cumulative manuscript, checkpoint 9 September 2026.

 

The free spectral correspondence in Section 16 does not remove the nonabelian terms of the original operator. We calculate those terms in the same exact tree and Haar coordinates, including the kinetic contribution, and exhibit a nonzero physical three-creation channel. Every statement in this section fixes the original finite box and $a>0$ before the small-positive-coupling limit. Bounds depending on that box are not asserted to be uniform in the continuum limit.

## Exact logarithmic fields and their retained density terms

Use the tree and chords of Section 14. To avoid confusing a coefficient matrix with the chart $\mathcal B_g$, write $t_{ce}$ for the original additive tree matrix and $b_{ce}$ for the following second integer matrix. If $e$ is a chord, set $l_{ce}=\delta_{ce}$ and $r_{ce}=0$. If $e$ is a tree edge, set $l_{ce}=\epsilon(s(c),e)$ and $r_{ce}=-\epsilon(t(c),e)$, where $\epsilon(v,e)$ records whether the root-to-$v$ tree path uses $e$. Then 

$$
\qquad\text{(168)}
 t_{ce}=l_{ce}+r_{ce},\qquad b_{ce}=r_{ce}-l_{ce},\qquad
 \mathcal X_{e,\alpha}=
       \sum_c(l_{ce}L_{c,\alpha}+r_{ce}R_{c,\alpha}).
$$

 This is exactly the original field obtained by varying that edge, recomputing the rooted chord products and differentiating. In particular each downstream tree holonomy has derivative $T_\alpha$, and the inverse target holonomy contributes the displayed minus sign. Product Haar measure makes each left and right field divergence-free.

Identify $y^\alpha T_\alpha$ with the real colour vector $y$. The Pauli multiplication law is 

$$
\qquad\text{(169)}
 (u\cdot T)(v\cdot T)
       =-\tfrac14(u\cdot v)I+\tfrac12(u\times v)\cdot T,
 \quad [u\cdot T,v\cdot T]=(u\times v)\cdot T.
$$

 Write $\operatorname{ad}_y v=y\times v$. Differentiation of the exponential power series, grouping the positions of the differentiated factor, gives 

$$
(d\exp)_Y(V)e^{-Y}=\int_0^1 e^{s\operatorname{ad}_Y}V\,ds.
$$

 Thus the exact logarithmic coordinate derivatives of left and right multiplication are respectively 

$$
F_-(\operatorname{ad}_y)T_\alpha,
 \quad F_+(\operatorname{ad}_y)T_\alpha,
 \qquad F_-(z)=\frac{z}{e^z-1},\quad F_+(z)=F_-(z)+z.
$$

 The values at zero are their removable continuations. On a sufficiently small original chart these are analytic matrix functions. Multiplying their series by the exponential series proves $F_-(z)=1-z/2+z^2/12+O(z^4)$ and $F_+(z)=1+z/2+z^2/12+O(z^4)$, including the zero cubic coefficient. The exact functions, rather than a truncated replacement, define all remainders below.

Put $d=3r$ and keep the exact chart (112), with $Z_c=\exp(gx_c\cdot T)$. On compactly supported smooth functions of $x$, whose support lies inside that chart for small $g$, define 

$$
Y_{e,\alpha}(g)=g\mathcal B_g\mathcal X_{e,\alpha}\mathcal B_g^*.
$$

 Let $D_{e,\alpha}(g)$ be the vector field whose $c$-component is $l_{ce}F_-(g\operatorname{ad}_{x_c})e_\alpha+
r_{ce}F_+(g\operatorname{ad}_{x_c})e_\alpha$. Density conjugation gives the exact equality 

$$
\qquad\text{(170)}
 Y_{e,\alpha}(g)=D_{e,\alpha}(g)
                 -\tfrac12D_{e,\alpha}(g)\log\mathcal J(gx).
$$

 Indeed apply the derivative to $\mathcal J(gx)^{-1/2}f(x)$ before multiplying by the chart density. Direct expansion of the retained sine density gives 

$$
\log\mathcal J(gx)=\log(16\pi^2)^{-r}
       -\frac{g^2}{12}\sum_c|x_c|^2
       -\frac{g^4}{1440}\sum_c|x_c|^4+O(g^6|x|^6).
$$

 For each $c$, all positive powers of $\operatorname{ad}_{x_c}$ are orthogonal to $x_c$. Consequently the radial contraction in (170) retains exactly the $t_{ce}$ term. The coefficients through order two are therefore 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 D^0_{e,\alpha}&=\sum_c t_{ce}\partial_{c,\alpha},\\
 D^1_{e,\alpha}&=\tfrac12\sum_c b_{ce}
                   (x_c\times e_\alpha)\cdot\nabla_c,\\
 D^2_{e,\alpha}&=\tfrac1{12}\sum_c t_{ce}
          [x_c\times(x_c\times e_\alpha)]\cdot\nabla_c,
 \qquad M^2_{e,\alpha}=\tfrac1{12}\sum_c t_{ce}x_c^\alpha,
       \qquad\text{(171)}\\
 Y_{e,\alpha}(g)&=D^0_{e,\alpha}+gD^1_{e,\alpha}
                   +g^2(D^2_{e,\alpha}+M^2_{e,\alpha})+O(g^4).
       
\end{aligned}
$$

 Here $M^2$ is multiplication. Its sign can also be verified without the density series: the divergences of $D^0,D^1$ are zero and $\operatorname{div}D^2=\sum_ct_{ce}x_c^\alpha/6$. Thus $D^2+M^2$ is skew-adjoint on flat compact test functions, as required by the exact Haar isometry. This check retains the term that would be missed by treating the chart density as constant.

## Every face coefficient and the full first two vertices

In the original ordered four-link word of a face, let $\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_4$ be the signed chord vectors, with zero for each tree link. Reversed traversal supplies the minus sign in that factor, without reversing the order of the four factors. For $k\ge1$ the exact Taylor coefficient of the full potential is 

$$
\qquad\text{(172)}
 W_{p,k}(x)=-\sum_{n_1+\cdots+n_4=k}
       \operatorname{tr}\!\left(\prod_{m=1}^4
                   \frac{(\zeta_m\cdot T)^{n_m}}{n_m!}\right),
 \qquad 2-\operatorname{tr}\prod_{m=1}^4 e^{g\zeta_m\cdot T}
           =\sum_{k\ge1}g^kW_{p,k}.
$$

 The constant term is zero because the original scalar $2$ cancels the trace of the identity at this configuration, not because the scalar Wilson term was removed from $H$.

The first coefficients can be written as the following complete recursion. Start with $A_0=B_0=C_0=0$ and set 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 A_m&=A_{m-1}+\zeta_m,\\
 B_m&=B_{m-1}+\tfrac12 A_{m-1}\times\zeta_m,\\
 C_m&=C_{m-1}+\tfrac12 B_{m-1}\times\zeta_m
   +\tfrac1{12}\{A_{m-1}\times(A_{m-1}\times\zeta_m)
          +\zeta_m\times(\zeta_m\times A_{m-1})\}.
       \qquad\text{(173)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 To verify the recursion, multiply the two exponential series through degree three using (169), and then use $\log(I+Q)=Q-Q^2/2+Q^3/3+O(Q^4)$. The linear coefficient is the sum, the quadratic cross coefficient is half the commutator, and the cubic coefficients are respectively one half and one twelfth as displayed. This finite multiplication proves that the logarithm of the face word is $(gA_4+g^2B_4+g^3C_4)\cdot T+O(g^4)$. Since $2-2\cos(|z|/2)=|z|^2/4-|z|^4/192+O(|z|^6)$, substitution proves, with $A=A_4,B=B_4,C=C_4$, 

$$
\qquad\text{(174)}
 W_{p,1}=0,\quad W_{p,2}=\tfrac14|A|^2,\quad
 W_{p,3}=\tfrac12 A\cdot B,\quad
 W_{p,4}=\tfrac14|B|^2+\tfrac12 A\cdot C-\tfrac1{192}|A|^4.
$$

 In particular the nested-commutator and negative fourth-order trace contributions remain alongside the positive square.

Write $\{S,T\}=ST+TS$. The original operator in the exact chart is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \widetilde H_g&=-\frac2a\sum_{e,\alpha}Y_{e,\alpha}(g)^2
       +\frac1{2g^2a}\sum_p
                      \left(2-\operatorname{tr}\prod_{m=1}^4e^{g\zeta_m\cdot T}\right),
       \qquad\text{(175)}\\
 H^{(1)}&=-\frac2a\sum_{e,\alpha}\{D^0_{e,\alpha},D^1_{e,\alpha}\}
                           +\frac1{2a}\sum_pW_{p,3},\\
 H^{(2)}&=-\frac2a\sum_{e,\alpha}
       \left((D^1_{e,\alpha})^2+
             \{D^0_{e,\alpha},D^2_{e,\alpha}+M^2_{e,\alpha}\}\right)
                           +\frac1{2a}\sum_pW_{p,4}.
       \qquad\text{(176)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 Its zeroth coefficient is exactly $H_{\rm osc}$ of Section 14. Define the remainder to be the difference of (175) and $H_{\rm osc}+gH^{(1)}+g^2H^{(2)}$; this definition retains every higher term.

We record the remainder control used below. Fix a small closed original ball $|y|\le\rho$ inside the logarithmic chart, with a slightly larger ball still inside it. Analyticity bounds all derivatives through any fixed finite order on that larger ball. Taylor's integral remainder for each coefficient of $Y$, and its first $x$ derivative, is bounded by a constant times $g^3(1+|x|)^m$ on $|gx|\le\rho$, for some fixed integer $m$; the zero cubic coefficient of $Y$ gives a stronger bound where needed. For the potential, fifth-order Taylor remainder before division by $g^2$ is bounded by $C g^5|x|^5$, so its operator remainder is bounded by $C g^3|x|^5/a$. These constants are finite sums of suprema of derivatives of the explicit functions above and depend on the fixed box, $a,\rho$. They are not uniform-limit claims.

Let $\chi$ be a smooth colour-invariant cutoff equal to one on $|y|\le\rho/2$ and zero before $|y|=\rho$. For any fixed polynomial times the comparison Gaussian $F$, the exact chart vector $\chi(gx)F(x)$, extended by zero, is smooth on the original compact manifold after applying $\mathcal B_g^*$. The preceding coefficient bounds and all Gaussian polynomial moments give 

$$
\qquad\text{(177)}
 \|[\widetilde H_g-H_{\rm osc}-gH^{(1)}-g^2H^{(2)}]
                       \chi(gx)F\|\le C_F g^3.
$$

 Derivatives of the cutoff are supported at $|x|\ge\rho/(2g)$. Their polynomial factors are bounded by powers of $g^{-1}$ and their Gaussian integrals by $C_Ng^N$ for every fixed $N$: bound the smallest Gaussian quadratic eigenvalue below and integrate $r^m e^{-cr^2}$ beyond that radius. This proves the same estimate when the cutoff is commuted past any displayed coefficient operator.

## A physical three-creation image of the complete cubic term

Let $V$ denote the matrix of all original transverse edge eigenvectors and $\Sigma=\operatorname{diag}\sigma_\nu$. Let $\iota$ insert chord coordinates with zero tree entries. The comparison Gaussian in $x$ has the matrix 

$$
\qquad\text{(178)}
 K=\iota^{\mathsf T}V\Sigma V^{\mathsf T}\iota
   =G^{-1/2}O\Sigma O^{\mathsf T}G^{-1/2},\qquad
 \Phi_0(x)=N_0\exp\left(-\tfrac18\sum_\alpha(x^\alpha)^{\mathsf T}Kx^\alpha\right).
$$

 Here $N_0$ is the already specified unit-vacuum constant in this coordinate measure. No trial state is changed by it. To prove the matrix identity, use $T\iota=I$ and $V=T^{\mathsf T}G^{-1/2}O$. Thus $V^{\mathsf T}\iota=O^{\mathsf T}G^{-1/2}$, which proves (178), positivity of $K$, and $T^{\mathsf T}K=V\Sigma V^{\mathsf T}\iota$.

For each colour put $p_c=(Kx)_c$, as a three-component vector, and set 

$$
v_e=\sum_c t_{ce}p_c,\qquad
 \theta_e=\sum_c b_{ce}x_c\times p_c.
$$

 Direct differentiation of the full Gaussian gives $D^0_{e,\alpha}\Phi_0=-v_e^\alpha\Phi_0/4$ and $D^1_{e,\alpha}\Phi_0=\theta_e^\alpha\Phi_0/8$. In $\sum_\alpha D^0_{e,\alpha}\theta_e^\alpha$ every derivative contracts two equal indices of the alternating colour tensor, so the sum is zero. In $\sum_\alpha D^1_{e,\alpha}v_e^\alpha$ the derivative forces the component $(x_c\times e_\alpha)_\alpha$, which is zero. The full first vertex therefore satisfies 

$$
\qquad\text{(179)}
 H^{(1)}\Phi_0=P_3(x)\Phi_0,\qquad
 P_3(x)=\frac1{8a}\sum_e v_e\cdot\theta_e
                      +\frac1{4a}\sum_p A_p\cdot B_p.
$$

 This calculation includes the kinetic part of the original nonlinear operator, rather than identifying the Wilson cubic term alone with the quantum vertex. Every term is invariant under simultaneous adjoint colour rotations and is odd under $x\mapsto-x$.

Expand this exact alternating polynomial as 

$$
P_3(x)=\sum_{i<j<k}c_{ijk}\,
                 x_i\cdot(x_j\times x_k).
$$

 Repeated chord indices give zero, and collecting distinct indices with their permutation signs determines each coefficient uniquely. Put 

$$
D=\sqrt2G^{1/2}O\Sigma^{-1/2},\qquad
 d_I=\sum_J c_J\det D_{J,I},\quad |I|=|J|=3,
 \quad E_I=\frac{\sigma_{i_1}+\sigma_{i_2}+\sigma_{i_3}}a.
$$

 The coordinate identity $x_c^\alpha=\sum_\nu D_{c\nu}
(a_{\nu\alpha}+a^\dagger_{\nu\alpha})$ then gives exactly 

$$
\qquad\text{(180)}
 P_3\Phi_0=\sum_{i<j<k}d_{ijk}\sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma}
   \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}
   a^\dagger_{i\alpha}a^\dagger_{j\beta}a^\dagger_{k\gamma}\Phi_0.
$$

 Each attempted one-creation contraction identifies two colours in $\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ and vanishes. The remaining coefficient is the alternating determinant of the three coordinate columns, proving the formula. Distinct ordered triples have disjoint mode occupations; the six nonzero colour assignments are orthogonal and each has norm one. Consequently 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \|P_3\Phi_0\|^2&=6\sum_I|d_I|^2
       =6c^*\bigwedge\nolimits^3(2K^{-1})c,\\
 \langle P_3\Phi_0,A_0P_3\Phi_0\rangle&=6\sum_I E_I|d_I|^2,
 \qquad A_0=H_{\rm osc}-\mu_0 .\qquad\text{(181)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 The second equality in the first line follows also by direct Gaussian contraction: two ordered colour determinants have inner product six times the determinant of their cross-covariance submatrix. Their covariance is exactly $2K^{-1}$ by (178). Thus the entire map preserves the original raw Gram factors and the physical three-colour singlet constraint.

## A finite rational certificate that the full vertex is nonzero

### Theorem 17.1.

On the original $L=2$ box, $H^{(1)}\Phi_0$ is a nonzero physical three-creation vector. For every original $a>0$, 

$$
\qquad\text{(182)}
 \|H^{(1)}\Phi_0\|^2>
              \frac{14641}{125000\sqrt3\,a^2},\qquad
 \|A_0^{-1}H^{(1)}\Phi_0\|^2>
              \frac{14641}{13500000\sqrt3}.
$$

### Proof.

Use the following three positively oriented original chords, in the displayed order: 

$$
c_1=((-1,1,-2),2),\qquad c_2=((-1,2,-2),3),\qquad
 c_3=((-1,1,-1),2).
$$

 Directions here are $1,2,3$ as in the original manuscript. Assign $x_{c_1}=e_1,x_{c_2}=e_2,x_{c_3}=e_3$ and all other chords zero. The face $((-1,1,-2);2,3)$ has first two factors with those positive vectors, third factor with $-e_3$, and fourth vector zero. All other faces involve fewer than these three nonzero colour vectors. Equation (174) gives the magnetic coefficient $-1/(8a)$.

Let $K_I$ be the three-by-three submatrix of $K$ in this ordered list and put $Q_I=(bV\Sigma V^{\mathsf T}\iota)_{I,I}$. The complete kinetic coefficient multiplied by $a$ is 

$$
\qquad\text{(183)}
 \frac18\sum_{j=1}^3(Q_I)_{j,\cdot}
                   \cdot\bigl(e_j\times(K_I)_{j,\cdot}\bigr).
$$

 This follows from $T^{\mathsf T}K=V\Sigma V^{\mathsf T}\iota$ in (179); all original tree paths in $b$ are retained.

Here are short rational enclosures for every entry. Each entry lies strictly between the corresponding integer below divided by $10^6$ and that integer plus one divided by $10^6$: 

$$
\qquad\text{(184)}
 10^6K_I:\quad
 \begin{pmatrix}
 1273974&432279&-317748\\
 432279&1273974&-386480\\
 -317748&-386480&1563504
 \end{pmatrix},\quad
 10^6Q_I:\quad
 \begin{pmatrix}
 -845265&-977768&417911\\
 473487&-1342407&1208367\\
 421454&840903&-1200597
 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

 We specify the exact finite calculation producing these bounds, so they are rational certificates rather than rounded numerical evidence. For $N=5$, use every frequency triple in $\{0,1,2,3,4\}^3$ with at least two positive entries. There are $125-1-12=112$ such blocks. Set $s_j=2\sin(\pi j/10)$ and $\sigma=\sqrt{\sum_i s_{j_i}^2}$. For an original edge $e=(n,i)$ put 

$$
\phi_e(\boldsymbol j)=w_{j_i}(n_i)\prod_{d\ne i}v_{j_d}(n_d),
$$

 with zero when $j_i=0$, and with the exact $v,w$ of Section 16. The contribution of that block to the full edge spectral matrix is 

$$
\qquad\text{(185)}
 S_{e,e'}(\boldsymbol j)=\sigma\phi_e(\boldsymbol j)
 \phi_{e'}(\boldsymbol j)
       \left(\delta_{i i'}-\frac{s_{j_i}s_{j_{i'}}}{\sigma^2}\right).
$$

 The two matrices in (184) are respectively the indicated entries of $\sum_{\boldsymbol j}S$ and $b\sum_{\boldsymbol j}S$. This is the complete transverse projection in each exact frequency block, so no choice or rounding of polarization vectors occurs.

Every trigonometric value here is an integer multiple of $\pi/10$. Start with $\sin(\pi/10)=(\sqrt5-1)/4$ and $\cos(\pi/10)=\sqrt{(5+\sqrt5)/8}$ and use the angle-addition recurrence up to multiples $0,\ldots,19$. These radical identities follow, for example, by $\cos5\theta=0$ and the larger positive root $\cos^2\theta=(5+\sqrt5)/8$; the bound $0<\theta<\pi/6$ selects $\theta=\pi/10$. Also retain the factors $\sqrt{1/5}$ and $\sqrt{2/5}$ in the original vertex and edge functions.

The included program `certify_nonabelian_vertex.py` evaluates precisely this finite sum using endpoints that are integers divided by $10^{40}$. Addition and negation are exact. For multiplication take the minimum and maximum of the four endpoint products and round outward by integer floor and ceiling division. For a nonzero-sign divisor apply the same rule to the four rational quotients. To enclose a positive square root with denominator $M=10^{40}$, take the integer floor of $\sqrt{lM}$ for the lower numerator and the integer ceiling of $\sqrt{uM}$ for the upper numerator, for input numerators $l,u$. The integer-square inequalities are checked directly. Monotonicity of each operation proves inductively that every resulting interval contains the exact radical value. Integer tree paths and the complete 112-block loops are specified in that source. The full interval endpoints, short bounds above, and final inequality are recorded in `NONABELIAN_VERTEX_CERTIFICATE.json`.

Inserting even the wider short intervals (184) into (183), and adding the exact $-1/8$ magnetic term, proves by rational arithmetic that the full coefficient $c$ obeys 

$$
\qquad\text{(186)}
 -\frac{243}{1000}<ac<-\frac{242}{1000}.
$$

 Sorting the three chord indices changes only its sign and not its absolute value in the alternating coefficient vector of (181).

Finally all original frequencies are at most $\sqrt{12}$, since each $s_j\le2$. Hence $0<K\le\sqrt{12}I$ by (178), and $2K^{-1}\ge I/\sqrt3$. Diagonalizing this positive matrix proves $\bigwedge^3(2K^{-1})\ge I/(3\sqrt3)$: its eigenvalues are the products of three of the original eigenvalues. Thus (181) is at least $2\sum_I|c_I|^2/\sqrt3$, which with (186) gives the first bound in (182). Each $E_I\le6\sqrt3/a$, so the inverse excitation multiplies the squared coefficient by at least $a^2/108$. This proves the second bound, with every physical spacing factor retained.

## The actual vacuum, raw quasimode Gram factor, and an observable response

The finite-box comparison spectrum has an isolated simple physical ground state and the actual low eigenvalues and projections converge, as proved in Section 14. We now use those facts with the controlled remainder, rather than assuming a formal perturbation series for the actual vacuum. Define 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \phi_1&=-A_0^{-1}P_3\Phi_0,\\
 E^{(2)}&=\langle\Phi_0,H^{(2)}\Phi_0\rangle
                  -6\sum_I\frac{|d_I|^2}{E_I},\\
 \phi_2&=-A_0^{-1}(I-|\Phi_0\rangle\langle\Phi_0|)
                       (H^{(1)}\phi_1+H^{(2)}\Phi_0).
       \qquad\text{(187)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 All inverses in this formula act on the physical vacuum complement of the fixed oscillator. These are finite explicit Fock calculations: the inputs are polynomial Gaussians, the coefficient operators are polynomial differential operators, and dividing each nonvacuum Fock coefficient by its sum of positive frequencies defines the inverse. They retain all intermediate physical modes produced by those polynomials. Oddness of $P_3$ gives the exact first energy coefficient $\langle\Phi_0,H^{(1)}\Phi_0\rangle=0$.

Set $F_g=\chi(gx)(\Phi_0+g\phi_1+g^2\phi_2)$ without dividing by its norm. Substitution of (187) into the exact operator, using (177), gives 

$$
\qquad\text{(188)}
 \|[\widetilde H_g-\mu_0-g^2E^{(2)}]F_g\|=O(g^3),
 \qquad \|F_g\|^2=1+g^2\|\phi_1\|^2+O(g^3).
$$

 For the residual, orders zero, one and two cancel by the displayed equations; their remaining polynomial-Gaussian terms have finite norm, and cutoff commutators have the Gaussian tail bound already proved. For the Gram factor, both $\phi_1,\phi_2$ are orthogonal to the vacuum by definition. Expanding the unaltered square and using the same tail bound proves the second equation.

The spectral theorem applied to this nonzero quasimode places an actual eigenvalue within $O(g^3)$ of $\mu_0+g^2E^{(2)}$: otherwise the residual norm would exceed that spectral distance times $\|F_g\|$. The fixed-box spectral separation identifies it as the unique actual vacuum eigenvalue. The orthogonal remainder of $F_g$ from its actual vacuum line has norm $O(g^3)$, by the same spectral theorem and the fixed positive separation from that line. Positivity and the already proved vacuum convergence fix the positive overlap. Its squared magnitude equals $\|F_g\|^2$ minus that orthogonal remainder's squared norm. Therefore the overlap is $1+O(g^2)$, and we obtain the actual statements 

$$
\qquad\text{(189)}
 \mathcal E_g=\mu_0+g^2E^{(2)}+O(g^3),\qquad
 \mathcal B_g\psi_g=\Phi_0+g\phi_1+O(g^2).
$$

 The only unit vector here is the originally specified actual vacuum. The raw trial vector and its nontrivial Gram factor in (188) have been left unchanged. In particular the second lower bound of (182) proves a nonzero first derivative of the actual vacuum in this exact coordinate frame.

There is also an explicit bounded physical observable that detects it. Choose even radial cutoffs $\chi_R(x)$, equal to one on $|x|\le R$ and zero for $|x|\ge2R$, with $0\le\chi_R\le1$, and set $O_R(x)=\chi_R(x)P_3(x)$. Its multiplication norm is finite at each fixed $R$. Lift it by the original logarithmic coordinate $x=y/g$ and set it zero outside the chart; for $2Rg<\rho$ this defines a globally smooth gauge-invariant multiplier $O_{R,g}$. Its prescribed dependence on $g$ is part of this exact observable map. Equation (189) gives 

$$
\qquad\text{(190)}
 \langle\psi_g,O_{R,g}\psi_g\rangle
   =-2g\langle\chi_RP_3\Phi_0,A_0^{-1}P_3\Phi_0\rangle+O_R(g^2).
$$

 The constant term is zero by parity. Multiplication is bounded, so the norm error in (189) controls every remaining term of this expectation. Gaussian domination gives $\chi_RP_3\Phi_0\to P_3\Phi_0$ in norm as $R\to\infty$. The limiting inner product is $6\sum_I|d_I|^2/E_I>0$ by the proved nonzero vertex. Fix the least integer $R$ for which the inner product exceeds half that positive quantity. Its existence follows from that norm convergence. This produces a fixed bounded observable prescription with a strictly negative nonzero first response for the actual positive-coupling vacuum. Neither a Gaussian replacement of that vacuum nor an assumption of interaction survival in the continuum is used.

## Exact relation to the full nonlinear coupling derivative

The retained source *Local-energy spacetime kernel and the exact nonlinear coupling response* proves differentiation on the original fixed Hilbert space. With $K_{\rm el}=\sum_eE_e$ and $W=\sum_p(2-W_p)$ its derivative is 

$$
V_g=\partial_gH_g=\frac{4g}{a}K_{\rm el}-\frac1{g^3a}W,
 \quad \psi'_g=-R_g(V_g-\mathcal E'_g)\psi_g,
 \quad R_g=(A_g|_{\psi_g^\perp})^{-1}P_{\psi_g^\perp}.
$$

 At each fixed $g>0$, smoothness of the simple vacuum follows directly from the resolvent identity on the common elliptic $H^2$ domain and a contour around that eigenvalue. Differentiating the eigen-equation and its original unit-norm constraint gives the displayed formula; the reduced inverse is bounded at that fixed regulator. The complete source, including all unbounded-operator domains and Duhamel terms, is retained with this manuscript.

There is an exact morphism from this derivative to the vertices calculated above. Differentiate the full density-bearing chart, at fixed original $F$, on any compact subset inside its logarithmic domain. The density terms in the two derivatives agree, giving 

$$
\qquad\text{(191)}
 (\partial_g\mathcal B_g)F=\frac1g\mathcal D\mathcal B_gF,
 \qquad \mathcal D=x\cdot\nabla+\frac d2,
 \qquad \mathcal D^*=-\mathcal D

 on compact test functions. Explicitly, differentiating $g^{d/2}$ gives $d/(2g)$, differentiating $\mathcal J(gx)^{1/2}$ gives $x\cdot\nabla_y\log\mathcal J(gx)/2$, and differentiating $F(gx)$ gives $x\cdot\nabla_yF(gx)$. Expanding $g^{-1}x\cdot\nabla_x(\mathcal B_gF)$ reproduces the latter two terms exactly. Integration by parts gives the stated skew-adjoint identity. It follows that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \partial_g\widetilde H_g
   &=\mathcal B_g V_g\mathcal B_g^*
                         +\frac1g[\mathcal D,\widetilde H_g],
       \qquad\text{(192)}\\
 \partial_g(\mathcal B_g\psi_g)
   &=\frac1g\mathcal D(\mathcal B_g\psi_g)
                 -\mathcal B_gR_g(V_g-\mathcal E'_g)\psi_g.
       
\end{aligned}
$$

 These equalities hold locally on the stated smooth coordinate domains; no derivative of a discontinuous boundary extension is taken. Products with the fixed interior cutoffs used above give the corresponding global test-vector identities. Thus $H^{(1)}$ is the regular first coefficient of the full coordinate derivative in (192). Omitting its commutator would confuse a changing coordinate frame with the fixed-Hilbert-space derivative and leave false singular terms. This explicit relation retains both derivatives and shows how they enter the same original operator.

## The first nonlinear coefficient of the original local covariance

The odd vacuum response above does not by itself give a nonzero first-order response for an even energy covariance. We calculate that covariance, retaining its full quadratic coefficient. For the fixed real original edge weights $f$, let $D_f^{(n)}$ be the coefficients of $\mathcal B_gD_{f,g}\mathcal B_g^*$. Their exact formulas are (175)--(176), with each electric edge term multiplied by $f_e$ and each face term by its original quarter-boundary average $f_p$. Write $D_f^{(0)}=D_0$, $D_f^{(1)}=D_1$, $D_f^{(2)}=D_2$ only in this subsection; these symbols denote the weighted operators, not the individual fields $D^n_{e,\alpha}$ above.

We first establish the order of the expansion on which this calculation depends. The same exact coefficient functions give 

$$
Y^{(3)}_{e,\alpha}=0,\qquad
 Y^{(4)}_{e,\alpha}=
 -\frac1{720}\sum_ct_{ce}(\operatorname{ad}_{x_c})^4e_\alpha
                       \cdot\nabla_c
 +\frac1{720}\sum_ct_{ce}|x_c|^2x_c^\alpha .
$$

 The fourth density coefficient follows by differentiating the retained $-g^4|x_c|^4/1440$ term; its radial contraction with every positive adjoint power is zero. Set $Y^{(2)}=D^2+M^2$. Then 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 H^{(3)}&=-\frac2a\sum_{e,\alpha}\{Y^{(1)}_{e,\alpha},Y^{(2)}_{e,\alpha}\}
                             +\frac1{2a}\sum_pW_{p,5},\\
 H^{(4)}&=-\frac2a\sum_{e,\alpha}
       \{(Y^{(2)}_{e,\alpha})^2+
                   \{Y^{(0)}_{e,\alpha},Y^{(4)}_{e,\alpha}\}\}
                             +\frac1{2a}\sum_pW_{p,6}.
\end{aligned}
$$

 The coefficients $W_{p,5},W_{p,6}$ are the full finite sums (172); no fifth or sixth power in an oriented factor is omitted. These formulas specify all coefficients needed for the following fourth-order quasimode.

Put $\phi_0=\Phi_0$. For $1\le n\le4$, recursively set 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 E^{(n)}&=\left\langle\Phi_0,
                   \sum_{k=1}^nH^{(k)}\phi_{n-k}\right\rangle,\\
 \phi_n&=-A_0^{-1}P_{\Phi_0^\perp}
             \sum_{k=1}^n(H^{(k)}-E^{(k)})\phi_{n-k}.
       \qquad\text{(193)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 These agree with the preceding coefficients at $n=1,2$. Induction proves that all inputs are finite physical polynomial Gaussians. It also proves their parity: conjugation by $\mathcal P F(x)=F(-x)$ multiplies $H^{(k)}$ by $(-1)^k$, as follows directly from the homogeneous coefficient degrees in the fields and potential. Hence $\phi_n$ has parity $(-1)^n$ and $E^{(1)}=E^{(3)}=0$. Taylor's integral remainder through the next order, with the same Gaussian cutoff estimates as (177), proves that $F_g^{[4]}=\chi(gx)\sum_{n=0}^4g^n\phi_n$ has residual $O(g^5)$ for its displayed eigenvalue polynomial. Its component off the actual vacuum line has both $L^2$ norm and $\widetilde H_g$ graph norm $O(g^5)$ by the fixed positive spectral separation and its residual.

This stronger graph estimate justifies applying the unbounded local operator to the actual vacuum expansion. Indeed on the original common smooth domain the commuting edge Casimirs give 

$$
\qquad\text{(194)}
 \|D_{f,g}u\|\le\|f\|_\infty
           \left(\|H_gu\|+\frac{4|\mathsf P_L|}{g^2a}\|u\|\right).
$$

 To verify it, the joint edge-Casimir expansion gives $\|\sum f_eE_eu\|\le\|f\|_\infty\|\sum E_eu\|$. Use $\kappa\sum E_e=H_g-bW$, $\|W\|\le4|\mathsf P_L|$, and $\|W_f\|\le\|f\|_\infty4|\mathsf P_L|$ to obtain the displayed sum, including both potential contributions. Consequently the $O(g^5)$ vacuum-complement remainder becomes only $O_f(g^3)$ after applying $D_{f,g}$. All polynomial terms themselves have the stronger local coefficient estimates already proved.

The raw overlap squared of $F_g^{[4]}$ with the actual vacuum is $1+g^2\|\phi_1\|^2+O(g^3)$. Comparing coefficients with the original unit-vacuum constraint therefore fixes 

$$
\chi_2=\phi_2-\tfrac12\|\phi_1\|^2\Phi_0,
 \qquad \mathcal B_g\psi_g
       =\Phi_0+g\phi_1+g^2\chi_2+O(g^3).
$$

 The expansion also holds after applying the weighted operator, with the corresponding coefficients, by (194). The term along $\Phi_0$ is thus explicitly retained; the raw quasimode was not normalized.

Define the following finite Fock vectors and scalars: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 m_0&=\langle\Phi_0,D_0\Phi_0\rangle,\\
 m_2&=\langle\Phi_0,D_2\Phi_0\rangle
       +2\operatorname{Re}\langle\phi_1,D_1\Phi_0\rangle
       +2\operatorname{Re}\langle\chi_2,D_0\Phi_0\rangle
       +\langle\phi_1,D_0\phi_1\rangle,\\
 \xi_0&=(D_0-m_0)\Phi_0,\qquad
 \xi_1=D_1\Phi_0+(D_0-m_0)\phi_1,\\
 \xi_2&=(D_2-m_2)\Phi_0+D_1\phi_1+(D_0-m_0)\chi_2.
       \qquad\text{(195)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 Parity gives $m_1=0$, $\xi_0,\xi_2$ even and $\xi_1$ odd. The preceding graph argument proves the actual expansions $m_{f,g}=m_0+g^2m_2+O_f(g^3)$ and $\mathcal B_g\Xi_{f,g}=\xi_0+g\xi_1+g^2\xi_2+O_f(g^3)$ in the required norms. This includes the motion of the vacuum and its scalar subtraction.

Put $S_0(t)=e^{-tA_0}$ and $A_2=H^{(2)}-E^{(2)}$. Define 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 S_1(t)&=-\int_0^t S_0(t-s)H^{(1)}S_0(s)\,ds,\\
 S_2(t)&=-\int_0^t S_0(t-s)A_2S_0(s)\,ds\\
 &\quad+\int_{0\le r\le s\le t}
 S_0(t-s)H^{(1)}S_0(s-r)H^{(1)}S_0(r)\,dr\,ds .
       \qquad\text{(196)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 These are finite-dimensional integrals on each polynomial input and the finite Fock spaces its indicated insertions generate. To prove the expansion for the actual semigroup, let $U_0=S_0(t)F$, $U_1=S_1(t)F$, $U_2=S_2(t)F$ for a fixed physical polynomial Gaussian $F$. Differentiation of these finite integrals gives $(\partial_t+A_0)U_0=0$, $(\partial_t+A_0)U_1=-H^{(1)}U_0$ and $(\partial_t+A_0)U_2=-H^{(1)}U_1-A_2U_0$. Their coefficients stay bounded on each fixed compact time interval. The cutoff sum $\chi(gx)(U_0+gU_1+g^2U_2)$ therefore has residual $O(g^3)$ for the actual equation $(\partial_t+\widetilde H_g-\mathcal E_g)U=0$, uniformly on that interval. Variation of constants and the actual excitation semigroup's contraction bound make its difference from the exact evolution at most the time integral of this residual. The cutoff tail is smaller than every power of $g$. This proves the actual semigroup expansion on these vectors without a bounded-operator perturbation assumption.

It follows that, at every fixed $L,a,f,t\ge0$, the original nonlinear covariance has the expansion 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 C_{g;f}(t)&=\langle\Xi_{f,g},e^{-tA_g}\Xi_{f,g}\rangle
       =C_{0;f}(t)+g^2 C_{2;f}(t)+O_{L,a,f,t}(g^3),
       \qquad\text{(197)}\\
 C_{2;f}(t)&=2\operatorname{Re}\langle\xi_2,S_0(t)\xi_0\rangle
       +\langle\xi_1,S_0(t)\xi_1\rangle\\
 &\quad+2\operatorname{Re}\langle\xi_1,S_1(t)\xi_0\rangle
       +\langle\xi_0,S_2(t)\xi_0\rangle .
\end{aligned}
$$

 There is no linear term: its two external-vector terms pair an odd vector with an even one, and its semigroup insertion is odd between two even vectors. The displayed second coefficient retains the quartic operator, both cubic insertions, every intermediate mode, the actual second vacuum coefficient and the centering correction.

For an entirely algebraic evaluation, take the original occupation basis with energies $\lambda_n=\sum_{\nu,\alpha}n_{\nu\alpha}
\sigma_\nu/a$. Its creation and annihilation matrix entries are $\sqrt{n_{\nu\alpha}+1}$ and $\sqrt{n_{\nu\alpha}}$ with the corresponding occupation changed by one. The polynomial formulas above determine every matrix entry from those rules. The time integrals are exactly 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 I_t(\alpha,\beta)&=
 \begin{cases}(e^{-t\alpha}-e^{-t\beta})/(\beta-\alpha),&\alpha\ne\beta,\\
 t e^{-t\alpha},&\alpha=\beta,
 \end{cases}\\
 (S_1)_{nm}&=-H^{(1)}_{nm}I_t(\lambda_n,\lambda_m),\\
 (S_2)_{nm}&=-(A_2)_{nm}I_t(\lambda_n,\lambda_m)
       +\sum_kH^{(1)}_{nk}H^{(1)}_{km}
                      J_t(\lambda_n,\lambda_k,\lambda_m),
       \qquad\text{(198)}
\end{aligned}
$$

 where for three distinct arguments $J_t(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=
\sum_{z\in\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}}
e^{-tz}/\prod_{w\ne z}(w-z)$. For exactly two equal arguments, symmetry gives 

$$
J_t(\alpha,\alpha,\gamma)=
 \frac{[t(\gamma-\alpha)-1]e^{-t\alpha}+e^{-t\gamma}}
                  {(\gamma-\alpha)^2},\qquad
 J_t(\alpha,\alpha,\alpha)=\tfrac12t^2e^{-t\alpha}.
$$

 These identities follow by integrating the two exponentials on the simplex in (196); the repeated cases follow by direct integration of the resulting linear factor. Only finitely many occupations enter (197), because all of its input vectors and insertions are polynomials of bounded degree. The formula does not discard other physical intermediate states that are reached by those insertions.

As an exact check on every subtraction, take $f_e=1$ on the full finite box. Then $D_n=H^{(n)}$, $D_0=H_{\rm osc}$, $m_0=\mu_0$ and $m_2=E^{(2)}$. The equations defining $\phi_1,\phi_2$ give $\xi_0=\xi_1=\xi_2=0$ individually. Thus both sides of (197) vanish, as the exact identity $\Xi_{1,g}=0$ requires. A formula omitting the vacuum response or its raw Gram coefficient would not pass these coefficient identities.

We have proved that the original nonlinear Hamiltonian has a nonzero colour-singlet cubic vertex, with an actual vacuum and observable response, even though Section 16's selected covariance limit admits the displayed free representation. The exact finite-box response and the full intermediate-state terms are now available for the joint regulator calculation. Their survival at fixed physical scales, higher local products, and an interacting continuum mass-gap violation are not established by the fixed-box bounds of this section. The original counterexample programme remains unfinished.
